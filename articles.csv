"The president-elect has railed against the policy, which is protected by the 14th Amendment. How his allies plan to end it.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/politics/birthright-citizenship-trumps-plan-end/,"President-elect Donald Trump’s team is assessing multiple options to fulfill his long-promised pledge to end birthright citizenship, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, teeing up a legal fight with the expectation that the Supreme Court would ultimately have to rule on the matter. Trump has railed against birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment, for yearsand suggested he’d use executive action to ban it. “We’re gonna have to get it changed, or maybe I would go back to the people, but we have to end it. We’re the only country that has it,” Trump toldNBC’s Kristen Welker,echoing a false statementhe’s made in the past. “If we can, through executive action. I was going to do it through executive action, but then we had to fix Covid first, to be honest with you.” In private, his allies have been crafting strategies to do that, including directing the State Department to not issue passports to children with undocumented parents and tighten requirements for tourist visas to crack down on “birth tourism,” according to two sources familiar with the planning. Multiple options are being kicked amongTrump allies to tighten the interpretation, keenly aware that any action would likely get legally challenged and eventually land before the Supreme Court. “Something has to kick off the legal battle,” one of the sources told CNN. The Trump transition pointed to Trump’s comments to Welker when asked for comment. Trump allies argue that the 14th Amendment has been misinterpreted and doesn’t apply to children born in the United States to undocumented parents. Some immigration hardliners have argued that children of undocumented immigrants are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the US and shouldn’t be consideredcitizens under the Constitution. About three dozen countriesprovide automatic citizenship to people born on their soil, including US neighbors Canada and Mexico and the majority of South American countries. There are about 4.4 million US-born children under 18 who live with an undocumented parent,according to the Pew Research Center. “This isn’t a barn-burning emergency. This doesn’t have to be done and completed and set in stone in year one. They know they’re going to the Supreme Court with it, and they’ll methodically make their case,” said another source familiar. A legal fight would be inevitable, but getting the Supreme Court to take up such a challenge is not a guarantee, and the high court will be less inclined to do so if there is no disagreement among the circuits about the meaning of birthright citizenship. But if the Trump administration brings the dispute to the court’s emergency docket, asking for the high court to pause a lower court order blocking the policy, the justices will have to take some sort of action. If the Supreme Court does take up a full review of the case, it could also duck the central constitutional questions by ruling against Trump based on the statute guaranteeing birthright citizenship instead. “I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s an offramp if they wanted it,” said Steve Vladeck, a CNN legal analyst and professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. The strategizing by the Trump team to try to end birthright citizenship has been matched by the preparations made by those who would challenge the move in court. “We expect to sue, and others will as well,” said Cody Wofsy, the deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project. “We have been very focused on what we’re going to do in this scenario and we’re ready to go.” Supporting the case for affirming birthright citizenship is in both the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which says that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,” and similar statute with origins that predate the constitutional provision. Longstanding Supreme Court precedents are also a major hurdle for the incoming Trump administration. An 1898 Supreme Court ruling upheld the amendment’s application to those born on US soil whose parents are noncitizens, while a 1982 case made clear that the amendment also applied to children who born to undocumented immigrants. “The history is clear. The constitutional text here is clear. The longstanding precedent is clear,” Wofsy said. “So, we are confident that, at the end of the day, the Constitution will prevail and people who are born here will continue to be recognized as US citizens.” Democratic attorneys general are eager to get into the fight as well. New JerseyAttorney General Matthew Platkin pointed to how the proposal could affect his wife, a daughter of Chinese immigrants who was born in Philadelphia. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Trump’s arguments for ending the right were “typical outlier extremist type of argument” that “won’t fly.” “We are definitely going to be suing him in court if there’s an attempt to deport US citizens,” he told CNN. Legal experts remain confident that birthright citizenship will remain even with a right-leaning Supreme Court that has shown willingness to overturn longstanding precedents on other issues, such as on abortion rights or regulatory power. Hiroshi Motomura, a scholar of immigration and citizenship at University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, said a Supreme Court reversal of the 1898birthright citizenship ruling would be “quite different” and “far more radical” than how the conservative majority has overturned other precedents like Roe v. Wade. “It really goes to how the nation sees itself and how it defines itself as a democracy,” Motomura told CNN, “The 14thAmendment and its interpretation comes out of history of being a nation and recognizing that to populate the nation and to settle the nation, you needed to give membership to people who were born in this country.”",Politics
6 key lines from Trump’s Sunday speech to conservative activists,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/politics/trump-turning-point-rally-key-lines/,"President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday, in his first rally-like speech since the November election, threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, pushed back on criticism of Elon Musk’s influence, and suggested he could soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump’s speech in Phoenix, at a Turning Point USA gathering of conservative activists celebrating his victory last month, largely echoed the rhetoric he used on the campaign trail — including lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election — but were tempered with his satisfaction at having won. “We had no riots. We had no anything. It was a beautiful thing to watch,” Trump said, noting Democrats’ concession of the 2024 election. “They just said, ‘We lost.’ And we want to try bringing everybody together.” Trump did not address the chaotic past week in Washington, which saw him play a central role in scuttling a House short-term government funding deal with a last-minute declaration of his opposition — and a ferocious social media campaign led by Musk against it. Their opposition set off a scramble that led lawmakers toapprove a different short-term measure, without the debt ceiling suspension Trump had demanded, to avert a government shutdown. Instead, Trump vowed to keep the promises he made on the campaign trail and to take action on his firsts day in office on, among other things, immigration, energy production and a series of culture war issues. Here are six key lines from Trump’s speech on Sunday: Trump said he would consider retaking control of the Panama Canal, which he referred to as a “vital national asset,” doubling down on social media posts he’d made on the topic Saturday. “Our Navy and commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, highly unfair, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama — I say, very foolishly, by the United States,” Trump said. “This complete rip-off of our country will immediately stop.” It was a demonstration of how the United States’ approach to foreign policy could shift under Trump, who has shown a willingness to use bellicose rhetoric — even toward allies — to accomplish his goals. He’s threatened 25% tariffs, for example, on Canada and Mexico on day 1 of his administration. The Panama Canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, is a vital passage for American commerce that was built principally by the United States and opened in 1914. President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty that began the process of transferring control of the canal to Panama in 1977, and that transfer was finalized in 1999. “It was given to Panama and to the people of Panama, but it has provisions — you’ve got to treat us fairly. And they haven’t treated us fairly,” Trump said. “We will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America in full, quickly and without question. I’m not going to stand for it. So to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly.” Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino stated in a video message Sunday afternoon that the Canal and its adjacent zone belong to Panama. “The sovereignty and independence of our country are not negotiable,” Mulino said ina statement posted on X, pointing to the 1977 treaty. “Panama respects other nations and demands respect. With the new government of the United States, I aspire to preserve and maintain a good and respectful relationship,” he added. “Security issues such as illegal migration, drug trafficking and organized crime should be a priority on our bilateral agenda, as they are a real threat that should concern us,” Mulino said. Trump suggested he could meet with Putin early in his presidency as he seeks to negotiate an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump said bringing the war to an end is “one of the things I want to do quickly,” and said Putin wants to meet with him “as soon as possible.” “So we have to wait for this. But we have to end that war,” Trump said. During Putin’s year-end media availability last week, he said he’s “ready” for potential talks with Trump. Trump pushed back on Democrats’ characterization of Musk as acting as the de facto president, after Musk — who has spent much time with Trump at Mar-a-Lago since the president-elect’s victory — helped tank the bipartisan government funding bill last week. “No, he’s not taking the presidency. I like having smart people,” he said. “They’re on a new kick. ‘Russia, Russia, Russia,’ ‘Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine,’ all the different hoaxes. The new one is ‘President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk.’ No, no, that’s not happening.” Trump went on to praise Musk’s company, SpaceX, for making advancements in space travel and for its Starlink satellite technology, but again reiterated that Musk is “not going to be president.” “No, he’s not going to be president, that I can tell you,” he said. “And I’m safe, you know why? He can’t be — he wasn’t born in this country.” Former President Barack Obama’s administration renamed the highest mountain peak in North America, Mount McKinley, to Denali to honor Alaska’s native population, which had used the name for centuries. Trump arrived at the topic after crediting President William McKinley with spurring the economic prosperity that allowed President Theodore Roosevelt’s administration to begin construction of the Panama Canal. Trump said McKinley should have his name restored because he was a “great president” who “deserves it.” “McKinley was a very good, maybe a great president. They took his name off Mount McKinley. That’s what they do to people,” Trump said. “President McKinley was the president that was responsible for creating a vast sum of money,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons that we’re going to bring back the name of Mount McKinley, because I think he deserves it.” Trump also said he would restore the names of military bases like North Carolina’s Fort Bragg, the former name of what’s now Fort Liberty. The name was changed in 2023 to strip the military base of its Confederate namesake. “Woke has to stop. Because along with everything else, it’s destroying our country. We’re going to stop woke,” Trump said. “Woke is bullsh*t.” Trump defended his controversial pick for Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — and seemed to suggest he would allow Kennedy to probe for links between vaccines and autism, despite no evidence supporting the connection that Kennedy has long claimed exists. Trump pointed to rises in diagnoses of autism, childhood cancer and chronic diseases, and said that “something’s wrong.” “Together, we’re going to make America healthy again,” Trump said. “Something bad is happening.” Kennedy’s long history of vaccine skepticism has been a source of focus for some Republican senators who are meeting with Trump’s Cabinet nominees ahead of confirmation hearings. Both Kennedy and Trump have in recent weeks sought to address those concerns — with Trump at a recent news conference describing himself as a “a big believer in the polio vaccine” and Kennedy saying he’s “all for” the vaccine. Still, at the same news conference, Trump similarly noted higher autism rates, and said he wants Kennedy to “come back with a report as to what he thinks. We’re going to find out a lot.” Trump again expressed openness to allowing the social media app TikTok to continue operating in the United States, suggesting that the app may have helped reach some key voters. His comments come as the Supreme Courtlast week agreed to decidewhether a controversial ban on the social media app violates the First Amendment. The high court agreed to expedite the case and hear arguments on January 10. Trump touted his popularity on the app and the gains he made with young voters in the 2024 election, saying he is “going to have to start thinking about TikTok.” “We did go on TikTok, and we had a great response. We had billions and billions of views,” he said. Trump said he was shown a chart highlighting the views his campaign had received there. “As I looked at it I said, ‘Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while,’” he said.",Politics
Why Ivanka Trump left politics and isn’t coming back to Washington,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/politics/ivanka-trump-out-of-politics/,"For Ivanka Trump’s entire adult life, she worked for her father. When Donald Trump was a real estate mogul, she was designing his next hotel. When he was on a reality TV show, she was in his television boardroom. When he was running for office, she was on the campaign trail. When he was president, she had an office in the West Wing. But in January of 2021, for the first time since she was 23 years old, she left Washington – and his employ. Ivanka Trump is done with politics and says she isn’t coming back. “I love my father very much. This time around I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics,” she said in a 2022 social mediapostafter her father announced his third run for the presidency. That statement remains true after Donald Trump’s 2024 victory, sources close to Ivanka Trump said, as she and her husband, Jared Kushner, seek a relatively private life in Miami, Florida, where they’ve spent the past four years largely outside of the public spotlight. It marks a dramatic turnaround for one of the former and future president’s closest aides, but an intentional one after the first four bruising years in the White House. Ivanka Trump faced constant scrutiny and criticism for decisions made by her father that she was unable to wholly influence or moderate. She was alienated by some liberal friends in her New York social circle, and she shut down a relatively successful eponymous clothing and accessories brand amid persistent ethics questions.Her departure from politics means her father is no longer her boss – and she is forging a new path with a definitively different lifestyle, one made possible asher family’s businesses have profited from proximity to the presidency and resulting relationships. “Politics is – it’s a pretty dark world. There’s a lot of darkness, a lot of negativity, and it’s just really at odds with what feels good for me as a human being,” she told “The Lex Fridman Podcast” in a three-hour conversation this July. “And you know, it’s a really rough business. So for me and my family, it feels right to not participate,” she added in what was her most substantive public reflection on her time in Washington and her life after. Still, a private life may prove elusive as a high-profile member of America’s incoming first family, one with a carefully cultivated personal brand and significant influence, beloved to many of the president-elect’s supporters and a target of many of his detractors. Trump remains very close with her father, with whom she talks regularly, a source close to her said. And she is likely to continue to informally advise him on a range of issues behind-the-scenes, sources told CNN. “She’s still his daughter, and a trusted voice, so in that sense an informal adviser, as we all are with our family members,” said Maggie Cordish, a longtime friend who joined Trump in the West Wing for a year working on paid family leave issues. During her time in the White House, staff and advisers took care to highlight her successes and counsel to the president. There was a robust public relations effort at times over those four years to ensure she got credit for her work – and distance from less popular policies. She publicly maintained a neatly tailored West Wing portfolio, turning her focus to less polarizing issues like criminal justice reform, combating human trafficking and workforce development. “Ivanka proudly spearheaded the White House’s efforts and promoted the administration’s success” on those policies, a representative for Trump said in a statement to CNN. Perhaps the work that left the most significant mark on Republican politics was her efforts toward paid family leave legislation and a child tax credit for working families. “She made those Republican issues. Really, they had not been Republican issues,” said a former colleague. This time around, sources said, her advice to her father is likely to stay under the radar. A source familiar with her thinking said that if Trump chooses to weigh in and have influence during her father’s second term, “It’s never going to be something that people are going to see publicly.” For his part, Kushner is also declining a formal role in the incoming administration, but is expected to be apivotal outside adviserto Donald Trump’s Middle East efforts, leveraging his close relationships with regional leaders. He also has significant financial interests in the region. And in a sign of the president-elect’s implicit trust in his family members, Jared Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, has been selected as US ambassador to France. Toward the end of Trump’s first term, Ivanka Trump had emerged as a more combative figure, adopting a posture aligned with her father as she lambasted what she cast as “partisan investigations.” She described herself as “unapologetically” opposed to abortion rights, and at the time,sources predicteda future run for political office, with one source who worked with the Trump family saying that Donald Trump viewed his daughter as “heir apparent.” But the end of the first Trump term marked necessary change for the family: Her father was largely exiled from Washington in the aftermath of January 6, 2021, and they left behind the drama of the nation’s capital for sunnier skies and Florida’s more welcoming political climate. Her decision to leave the political fray may have also been shaped by more challenging personal moments over the past four years. Ivana Trump, her beloved mother, unexpectedly passed away at her New York City home in July 2022. “The loss of a parent is one of life’s very painful passages for which one is never fully prepared. It hits at the very core of your being. And it takes a good amount of time to emerge from how it dislocates you,” she wrote in an Instagrampostreflecting on her first holiday season since her mother’s death. She has also beencaringfor her 98-year-old maternal grandmother, known as “Babi,” who lives with the family in Miami. And her husband has also contended with health issues, revealing in his 2022 memoir that he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2019 and had surgery to remove a growth on his thyroid. Kushner had a second thyroid surgery in August 2022, a source close to him toldReutersat the time. Friends describe a gradual shift from Trump’s more public-facing and aggressive posture to her current position beginning with the family’s January 2021 move to Miami, where they settled into an oceanfront condo in the Surfside area before later relocating to a mansion in the exclusive Indian Creek Island enclave. Multiple friends say she’s at peace with her decision to step away from politics, telling CNN that she is prioritizing her family, attempting to find some privacy, and pursuing new interests. “Her children are in a sweet spot where they’re all critical ages, they’re tweens and teens, and it’s short – it’s really brief. She loves being with her children, and she’s found a lot of peace and happiness in her private life,” said Cordish. Trump has tapped into a wide-ranging series of new hobbies. Her social media posts are peppered with images of her and her family gardening, practicing jiu-jitsu at the Valente Brothers’ studio, learning to surf at Kelly Slater’s Surf Ranch, playing polo on horseback, driving motocross bikes and playing board games. She told Fridman that the decision not to be involved in politics “was rooted in me being a parent – really thinking about what they need from me now.” “I know today the cost they would pay for me being all in, emotionally, in terms of my absence at such a formative point in their life, and I’m not willing to make them bear that cost,” she said. Trump’s self-imposed retreat from public life was briefly paused in 2023, as she wasforced to testifyin the New York civil fraud trial against her father and his company, detailing her role in negotiating loans for Donald Trump’s purchases of his Doral resort in Florida and the Old Post Office building in Washington, DC. While he stood trial in a hush money case earlier this year, family members flocked to the courthouse to stand by him, but Ivanka Trump was notably not present. After his conviction, she traveled to New York to support her father, but stayed out of sight at Trump Tower. He was found guilty of 34 charges of falsifying business records – a felony conviction for which he has yet to be sentenced. Trump pleaded not guilty and has denied wrongdoing in all cases against him. Meanwhile, her brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump fully embraced their father’s “Make America Great Again” movement, in part filling the vacuum created by their sister’s campaign trail absence. Eric Trump’s wife, Lara Trump, became a key spokesperson and co-chair of the Republican National Committee during her father-in-law’s political comeback. Since the election, she has said she’s stepping down from the RNC and initially signaled her willingness to fill an expected Florida senate seat opening, pending Sen. Marco Rubio’s confirmation as secretary of state. But shewithdrew from considerationSaturday. With the door firmly closed to a return to political life for now, Ivanka Trump is likely to spend her father’s second term using her influence in new ways, including in the nonprofit space, with a focus on food insecurity, supporting farmers, and disaster relief, a source close to her said. “She is choosing to use her influence now on a more personal level” to “positively impact her own community,” the source said, adding, “Being able to have an impact in that way, while allowing her the time to be prioritizing her young children and their privacy, is where she wants to be.” She has worked with victims of the Hawaii wildfires and North Carolina hurricanes, volunteered with Ukrainian refugees in Poland, and packed food boxes at a local kosher food bank. Dave Donaldson, the president of CityServe, a nonprofit organization where she has volunteered, welcomed what he described as Ivanka Trump’s “compassion portfolio.” “She’ll continue to work with us on helping victims of disasters, wars – but why does somebody need to be in government to do that? The reality is that most of the compassion work being done around the world is outside government,” Donaldson told CNN. She posts frequently about her volunteer work on social media as she presents a new iteration of herself to her followers with glossy, polished photography. “She is very brand aware, very conscious of wanting to do something positive – and that’s not a bad thing – but has a little bit of reputational buildup to accomplish and reach that bigger goal,” said one crisis communications and reputational management expert. “I don’t doubt the sincerity, but if I were advising her, I would just encourage her to take a little bit of the polish off.” Trump and Kushner have also returned to the world of real estate, developing luxury projects, including a 1,400-acre Albanian island that has garnered somecontroversy. “It’s amazing to bring together all of this talent, and for me to be able to play around and flex the real estate muscles again and have some fun with it,” Trump told Fridman. And she is doing some “quiet investing in certain areas of interest,” the source familiar with her thinking said, declining to provide additional details when pressed.

Manchin torches Democrats on the way out the door,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/politics/joe-manchin-congress-democratic-party/,"For more on Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, watch CNN’s “Inside Politics with Manu Raju” at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m. ET. As Joe Manchin prepares to leave Congress after nearly 15 years, the West Virginia senator — wholeft the Democratic Partyand registered as an independent earlier this year — is further distancing himself from his former party, calling the Democratic brand “toxic.” “The D-brand has been so maligned from the standpoint of, it’s just, it’s toxic,” Manchin told CNN’s Manu Raju in an interview airing Sunday, citing the shift as the reason why he left the party. Adding that he no longer considers himself a Democrat “in the form of what Democratic Party has turned itself into,” Manchin — who has long been a pivotal swing vote in the Senate — said the party’s brand has become about telling people what they can and can’t do, blaming progressives for the change. “They have basically expanded upon thinking, ‘Well, we want to protect you there, but we’re going to tell you how you should live your life from that far on,’” Manchin added. Manchin cast progressives — a small number of lawmakers within the party who he claims have an outsize influence — as being out of touch with the majority of Americans. “This country is not going left,” he said. The former West Virginia governor-turned-senator shared that he was a lifelong Democrat because the party used to focus on kitchen-table issues such as “good job, a good pay,” but claimed Democrats are now too worried about sensitive social issues, such as transgender rights, while taking “no responsibility at all” for the federal budget during the election. But Manchin said Republicans don’t take responsibility for the national debt either, criticizing them further for lacking common sense on the issue of guns. “They’re too extreme, it’s just common sense,” Manchin said. “I’m not going to ban you from buying it, but you’re going to have to show some responsibility.” “So the Democrats go too far, want to ban. The Republican says, ‘Oh, let the good times roll. Let anybody have anything they want,’” Manchin added. “Just some commonsense things there.” When asked about incoming House Progressive Caucus Chair Greg Casar’s remarks that Democrats would have won the election if the party was more like outgoing caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal and less like Manchin, the senator told Raju: “For someone to say that, they’ve got to be completely insane.” “The people in America voted,” Manchin said. “They had that opportunity, you know, to vote with Kamala Harris and with Donald Trump. Donald Trump, there’s not much hasn’t been said. You know exactly what you’re getting. He hasn’t made any bones about it.” He added: “You might say, ‘That’s too far right.’ OK. If that’s the case, then why did they go too far right when Kamala was trying to come back to the middle a little bit?” Instead, Manchin blamed Vice President Harris’ loss on her inability to cast herself as a moderate candidate afterchampioning progressive issuesduring her first presidential run in 2019. “If you try to be somebody you’re not, it’s hard,” Manchin said. Hedeclined to endorse the vice presidentahead of the election. While he dodged questions on whom he voted for in November, Manchin shared he likes Trump and gets “along fine” with him. He added that during the Army-Navy football game last weekend, he told the president-elect, “I want to help any way I can.” “I want you to succeed,” Manchin said he told Trump. “Every red-blooded American should want your president to succeed, whether you vote for him or not, whether the same party or not, whether you like him or not.” Before Manchin left the party earlier this year, the senator consideredjumping into the presidential raceto challengeJoe Bidenin the Democratic primary and debated a run again after the president ended his campaign. But Manchin told Raju that while he saw an “avenue” in people not wanting a repeat of Biden versus Trump and instead looking for a centrist candidate, he didn’t believe he had a chance of making it on the ballot in all 50 states. Sharing that he had tried to explore a run with the centrist group No Labels, Manchin said he realized that “I have no chance of winning if I can’t participate in all 50 states.” “So why would I put myself through that, or anyone else, and go down in history books as a spoiler?” Manchin added. No Labelsultimately abandoned its plansto form a third-party presidential unity ticket for the 2024 election. But Manchin stressed there is an appetite for moderates in Congress and the White House, highlighting the significance of centrist voters. “The centrist-moderate vote decides who’s going to be the president of the United States. And when they get here, they don’t govern that way. Neither side does. They go to their respective corners,” Manchin said. “So if the center had a voice and had a party that could make both of these — the Democrat, Republican Party — come back, OK, that would be something.” When asked by Raju whether he thinks it’s time for a third party, Manchin said he believes so. The senator added the third party would be called the “American Party” and would serve as a space for moderate Democrats and Republicans. But he shared he would not be its leader. “I’ll be out there rooting. I’ll be the best cheerleader they’ve ever had,” Manchin said. The outgoing senator will be succeeded by West Virginia GOP Gov. Jim Justice, a flipped seat that will give Republicans control of the chamber, along with a GOP majority in the House. Asked whether he’ll miss the Senate, Manchin said, “I don’t think so.” The senator, who once famously said the chamber “sucks,” said the sentiment stands but contended the House “sucks worse.” “Those poor guys. I feel so sorry for them over there,” Manchin said. “They can’t move. They are in dead heat.” But as he reflects on his career in politics, Manchin looks at the past 40-plus years fondly. “It’s been an honor of a lifetime to serve the people of my great state and to be able to contribute to my great country,” Manchin said.

A picture is emerging of Resistance 2.0 as liberal leaders seek to launch opposition to Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/politics/resistance-trump-liberal-groups/,"The question has loomed over Democrats and their allies sinceDonald Trumpwas elected to a second term: Do party leaders and liberal, pro-democracy activists have the juice to launch a passionate, organized opposition to Trump and the Republican congressional trifecta? The early takes, in the days and weeks after the election, were gloomy, bordering on defeatist. But less than a month now before Trump’s second inauguration, a picture is emerging of Resistance 2.0. It’s out with the“pink pussy hats”and often performative pop culture gesturing and in with strategic confrontation, from the halls of Congress to the courts and, when called for, the streets. That, at least, is the plan. “We don’t have rose-colored glasses. This is going to be a hard fight. They are more organized than they were last time. The landscape has moved further to the right in many ways in terms of the governmental balance of power,” said Skye Perryman, the leader of Democracy Forward, a left-leaning legal organization. “But there are real opportunities with both where the American people are on issues as well as with where the judicial landscape is.” Organizers and activists repeated varying versions of this argument in dozens of interviews with CNN over the last few weeks: Yes, Trump and his movement are better poised to act than they were when he first entered the White House in 2017. But so are we. Democracy Forward, Perryman said, has been studying documents like Project 2025 and mapping out where legal battlegrounds and working with hundreds of lawyers from nearly 300 organizations to coordinate a proactive response to what she called a fundamentally unchanged far-right playbook. Several groups, including those focused on immediate pressure points, like Trump’smass deportation plans, said they expect supports to turn out in full force when inevitable crises emerge. There is also a growing sense that the GOP’s narrow congressional majorities are at risk of splintering under pressure from a well-organized opposition. The Republican bust-upover funding the governmentproves, advocates said — in conversations both before and after the fight exploded — that Trump’s agenda is ripe for spoiling. “There will be policies that will cause clear riffs and divisions in their own base, in their own voter coalition,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party. Those cracks are already showing up on Capitol Hill as some conservative Republican lawmakers butt heads with Trump and influential allies, likebillionaire Elon Musk, over the outline of a spending bill to keep the government running. Leaders of groups like Indivisible, which sprung up in the aftermath of Trump’s 2016 victory, balk at the assumption that Trump’s popular vote victory, powered in part bygains in some Democratic strongholds, had demoralized the “resistance” to the point of paralysis. Mostly, they point to the calendar – and to some revisionist history regarding Trump’s first election. The Women’s March, multiple activists noted, did not come until the day after his inauguration, on January 21, 2017. The Democratic Party, post-2016, was arguably in a deeper funk and more contentious state of internecine battle. Ezra Levin, the co-founder of Indivisible, said the political landscape has changed so much over the past eight years that it effectively zeroes out any apples to apples comparisons. “The Trump election in 2016 was a total surprise and seemed like an accident of history. We didn’t think the threat was that real. We didn’t do as much as we might have been able to do. And then this guy squeaked through,” Levin said, describing the motivating frustrations from 2016 and 2017. This time, he added, there is no suggestion that Trump’s ascent was a fluke. And though that might be dispiriting to some Democrats, it is also useful lesson – the search for a quick fix or white knight, in the form of a character such asspecial counsel Robert Muellerand his Russian election interference probe, is not on the table. “I don’t really give a sh*t about the spin. There’s either going to be a movement or there isn’t, and the proof is going to be in the pudding,” Levin said. “But I wouldn’t though expect more than what I’m seeing now. We had a 140,000 people on a call two days after the election.” Those numbers are growing, he said. MoveOn, another older liberal activist group, and the Working Families Party have reported similarly estimable engagement stats. Some Democrats have also noted the makeup of the state and federal judiciary is, on balance, slightly better for the party than entering 2017. Democrats, too, have considerably more power now at the state executive and legislative levels. Michigan is a prime example. Republicans there had a supermajority in 2016, with Democrats down to under a dozen seats in both the state Senate and House. The GOP controlled the offices of the secretary of state, attorney general and governor. Entering 2025, the executive seats are all held by Democrats, who also have legislative majorities. “We’re in a bit of a different position here to be able to fight back and maybe see people feel a little less powerless than they did in 2016,” said Curtis Hertel, a former state senator and candidate to become Michigan Democratic Party chair. “But that doesn’t mean (people) are not on the ground, ready to move and looking at ways to build new coalitions across the state.” Angst over the willingness of Democrats, from the party’s rank and file to its traditionally energetic advocates, to remain engaged and push back against Trump’s agenda has been a talking point both on the ground and among the party’s most prominent figures. “Many people have come up to me, telling me they feel tired, maybe even resigned – folks who have said to me that they’re not sure whether they have the strength, much less the desire, to stay in the fight,” Vice President Kamala Harrissaid in a speechto young leaders in mid-December. “But let me be very clear. No one can walk away. … We must stay in the fight, every one of us.” The incoming chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Texas Rep. Greg Casar, acknowledged that the period of “grief and soul-searching” is not yet over. But he argued that internal debate would benefit the party – in the coming weeks and as the next round of elections come into focus. “People didn’t sit in at the lunch counters just once, people didn’t go and vote during the Civil Rights Movement in only one election cycle. This takes some time,” Casar said. “There is a deliberate Republican strategy to get people to give up. I see it every day on Capitol Hill.” As Democrats work to rehabilitate their own image with voters, they are hoping the incoming Trump administration will help offer a strong contrast. Organizers pointed to the successful effort in 2017 to block the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which led to the health care law being a positive campaign issue for Democrats for the first time during the 2018 midterm elections. The upcoming debate over extending the GOP’s 2017 tax cuts could offer a similar opportunity, Democrats say. “Those kinds of fights, I think, will energize the Democratic Party and become the defining issues in the 2026 elections and beyond,” said Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party and a candidate to lead the national party. Democrats must also grapple with which policy fights to take on. Usamah Andrabi, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, a progressive group that formed days after Trump’s first inauguration, said Democrats need to rebuild their image as a party of the working class and pressure Republicans to vote on populist policies, such as raising taxes on billionaires. “We have been, for years, a party against Trump instead of a party for something,” Andrabi said. “We cannot just fight against Trump and just say this policy is bad.” Molly Murphy, a pollster for Harris’ presidential campaign, told Democratic National Committee members this month that they must change their approach to Trump during his second term by emphasizing pocketbook issues over his Cabinet picks and various outrages. “The 2025 playbook cannot be the 2017 playbook,” Murphy said during a presentation at a DNC executive committee meeting. A Quinnipiac University pollreleased December 16 found that 53% of voters are optimistic about Trump’s second term. But the poll also found majorities opposed key parts of his agenda: Fifty-one percent of voters opposed his plan to launch tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada. On immigration, 55% of voters said they prefer giving most undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship, compared with 36% who said they want the US to deport most migrants. Sixty-three percent of voters said they support birthright citizenship. “That’s not what the marginal voter who gave him the plurality of votes in key states was voting for,” Levin said. “They were voting for lower egg prices.” Mitchell, the Working Families Party leader, also argued that early reporting and opinion pieces “have been premature in trying to tell a story about where people are at and what people are willing to do.” Still, he told CNN that “Trump 1.0 will not be Trump 2.0, and we will not be the movement of 2016 and 2017.” Back then, he recalled, “there was a march for every issue. There was the tax march, there was the Women’s March, there was the science march. … Those tactics made sense then, but we can’t simply engage in mass mobilizations every time there’s a new issue or a new Trump program that we’re opposed to.” That understanding, he and others told CNN, should guide both Democrats in office and advocacy groups dedicated to stopping or stalling the new administration’s agenda. There should be less focus, these leaders said, on puncturing what has often been described by liberals as a personality campaign designed to sour Trump voters on Trump. “If Trump does the bidding of Big Tech, Big Oil and the billionaires who bankrolled his campaign, as early signs suggest, we must expose this monumental betrayal of the working people who voted for him seeking lower costs and a better living standard,” Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a speech earlier this month. Only by seizing on those opportunities, she continued, could Democrats and their allies hope to “reconnect” with the working- and middle-class voters who are moving away from the party. Bruna Sollod, the senior political director at United We Dream, an immigrant advocacy group, said her organization is focused on making sure those threatened by Trump’s promised deportation sweeps have the information they need, along with paperwork that could be critical in the coming month. But their message, she said, will also address deeper concerns highlighted by the president-elect’s gains among voters who had once been expected by political operatives to immediately reject his anti-immigrant rhetoric. “We completely understand that there’s people within our own communities – people who may have voted for Trump, who were immigrants in the past, or have immigrant family members – they feel like let down by the Democratic Party,” Sollod said. “We understand that we’re just in a very different place than we were in 2017.” The group plans to lean into messaging about how immigrants contribute to the economy to counter the incoming president’s rhetoric and is already pressuring allies at the federal, state and local level to push back on Trump’s immigration agenda. The group is also holding additional informational sessions around concerns such as the rights of DACA recipients and others who could come into the administration’s crosshairs. For transgender rights advocates, the 2025 landscape it already taking shape. Throughout his campaign Trump vowed to block transgender girls from playing on girls sports teams. And the US Supreme Court, now dominated by a conservative supermajority,recently heard argumentson a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors. “There is organizing and direct-action planning occurring,” said Ash Lazarus Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality. “It just may look a little different than it has in the past, because we are operating under a new territory now.” Advocates for Trans Equality released an updated version of itslegal survival guidelast month and has urged transgender Americans to update their legal documents and renew their passports. “We are still really in that early stage of Trump has been elected, but he’s not in office yet, so what can we do right now to best prepare,” Orr said. “​​Right now, our main focus is preparing our community as much as possible.” This article has been updated.

A Georgia case could make parents think twice about letting their children run free,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/us/mother-arrested-missing-son-georgia-cec/,"It was near the end of an unusual day for the four Patterson children when the deputies came to arrest their mother. The sheriff’s deputies approached the house, a tidy split-level outside Blue Ridge, Georgia, with chickens roaming the front yard and yellow flowers blooming along the front steps. What happened next was captured on a body-worn camera. Deputy Kaylee Robertson knocked on the glass. She wore an army-green vest over her short-sleeved uniform shirt. Visible on her left arm was the tattoo of a cartoon character: Blossom, leader of the Powerpuff Girls, who use their superpowers to fight crime.The door creaked open. “Hey Brittany,” the deputy said, making a come-here motion with her left hand, “I need you to come out here.” Still on the phone, Brittany Patterson apparently asked for more time. “No,” the deputy said with authority. “Not ‘one second.’ I need you to come out here.” Patterson was a 41-year-old real-estate agent. She stepped outside, into the autumn twilight. “Okay,” the deputy said. “Turn around for me.” “Why?” Patterson said. “Because you’re under arrest,” the deputy said. “For what,” Patterson said, her tone soft and incredulous. “For the incident we talked about earlier today,” Robertson said. This incident would soon make national headlines. It would draw indignant comments about parental rights and governmental overreach. It would leadone local columnistto suggest that safety-obsessed adults might as well be shrouding children in bubble wrap. And it would raise an uncomfortable question: Can it be a crime not to know where your children are? A CNN review of police documents, body-camera videos, and a 911 call sheds new light on a case that could make parents think twice about letting their children run free. “What am I under arrest for?” Patterson said. “For reckless endangerment,” the deputy said. This was not quite correct. The charge on the warrant was misdemeanor reckless conduct, under a Georgia law that functions as a catch-all for a wide range of allegedly criminal behavior. A defense attorney told CNN this charge is rarely used in cases that center on child safety. “And how was I recklessly endangering my child?” Patterson said. The other deputy cut in. “Turn around,” he said to Patterson. “We’re not — we’re not talking about it.” Patterson turned around and offered her hands. As the deputies fastened the cuffs, she looked in through the doorway at her 10-year-old son. She told him to call his grandmother, and to tell her “they’re taking me to jail because you decided to walk down the street.” This punchy summary of the case —they’re taking me to jail because you decided to walk down the street— is accurate to a point, if oversimplified. What it really comes down to is the wordmissing, and how one defines it, and whether Patterson’s son was actually missing when she left the home. And, if so, whether that decision constitutes the sort of criminal conduct that could put someone in jail for up to 12 months. The Pattersons live in the hills of Appalachia, about 100 miles north of Atlanta. This incident began around lunchtime on a Wednesday in late October, when the children were 16, 14, 12 and 10. Patterson’s older son had an appointment with a chiropractor. No one else was home except Patterson’s father, who lives in the basement. Patterson’s husband has a job in another state. Her younger son is home-schooled. She had just seen him a few minutes earlier, in his room, looking for his belt. Now, ready to leave, she called for him. He did not answer. In an interview with CNN, Patterson said she and her husband had decided long ago to give their children a fair amount of both freedom and responsibility. “There’s no freeloaders allowed in my house,” she said. The children cut the grass. They keep the wood stove burning. They take turns doing the laundry. And they roam around the woods. Patterson said she grew up with similar freedom. Her own mother lives nearby, and sometimes questions her daughter’s choices. Patterson says she feels as if “my house is never clean enough, my kids are never well-enough behaved.” But Patterson roamed all around Daytona Beach, Florida, when she was a kid, and sometimes she reminds her mother of this. “I’m like, ‘Mom, you never knew whereIwas.’” So, even though her 10-year-old wasn’t answering, Patterson wasn’t worried. She figured he’d gone to the place in the woods where he sometimes liked to be alone. Later, she found out that he had indeed gone to the woods, to a vantage point from which he could see her drive away. A while later, at the chiropractor’s office in nearby Ellijay, Patterson got a phone call. She sent it to voicemail. When the same number called again, she answered. The call was recorded. “Hello, this is Brit,” she said. “Hey,” a woman said. “This is Deputy Robertson, Fannin County Sheriff’s Office.” Patterson still doesn’t knowwhyher son walked a mile down the road to Mineral Bluff. Sometimes boys just do things. Was it a dangerous walk? This, too, was subjective. The prosecutor, Emma Harper, certainly thought so. Later, in a phone call to Patterson’s attorney, David DeLugas, which DeLugas legally recorded and shared with CNN, the prosecutor called it “a busy highway with no sidewalk” and said, “It’s not walkable. It’s not safe … That’s not a thing that you do here. Because you’re gonna get hit by a car.” Harper did not return a phone call from CNN. Nor did her boss, District Attorney Frank Wood. According to Google Street View, the speed limit along the route in question is 35 or 25 mph. There is no sidewalk, but Patterson says her son walked part of the way on a dirt path behind a guardrail. He was not hit by a car. Nevertheless, someone called 911. On the recording, the woman said she was at the fire station on Mineral Bluff Highway. She had recently seen a boy, “about 6 or 8 years old,” walking alone. “I stopped to ask him if he was okay and he needed help, and he lied, and said that his mother works here at the post office,” the caller said. “And then he just took off away from me.” Deputy Robertson found him on Railroad Avenue. On her body camera, he sat in the back of the cruiser, half-shrouded in darkness, eyes shadowed beneath the brim of his Atlanta Braves cap. He wore jeans and a blue-and-gray T-shirt. Robertson called the boy’s mother and tried to get some answers. Patterson explained what happened: the chiropractor appointment, the kid she couldn’t find, the assumption that he’d walked into the woods. “Okay,” Robertson said. “You didn’t think to call us?” “Well, no, because I figured he’d come home. He’s done this before. Walk back in the woods when he gets mad or frustrated, and then he’ll come home like an hour later. So, he’s never walked all the way to Mineral Bluff, though.” She continued. “And honestly, I didn’t know I could just call you guys when I wasn’t 100 percent sure he was missing.” “Okay, um,” Robertson said, looking for the right words, “I mean, yeah, that’s kinda important, uh, to, to let us know if you can’t find your child.” Any parent will tell you that children go missing all the time. They climb trees. They hide behind couches. They go into closets and fall asleep. None of this means they aremissingin the sense of amissing-persons report. Later, with some time to think about this distinction, Patterson was even more displeased with the deputy. She imagined what would have happened if shehadcalled the sheriff’s office a few minutes after she’d last seen her son. “What do you think they would have done?” she said. “Nothing.” Fannin County Sheriff Dane Kirby did not respond to interview requests for this story. When a CNN reporter called to ask for an interview with Deputy Robertson, Major Keith Bosen said, “And unfortunately, our policy’s not going to allow her to speak about an ongoing investigation.” The deputies brought the boy home to his grandfather. The boy’s mother got home. She gave him a talking-to for walking to town without asking permission first. She said he would have to lose some privileges and do some extra chores. “There was already discipline taking place,” she said. There would be more. Parenting and law enforcement are alike in some ways. Both are inexact sciences, driven by split-second decisions and subjective interpretations of a malleable set of standards. When can children be left alone?The state of Georgia has guidelines, and even those guidelines are vague. Sometimes you justdon’t likea thing someone did, even when it’s hard to find the rule or law they broke. Georgia’s reckless conduct statute covers a lot of ground. In a breathtaking 67-word sentence, it reads, “A person who causes bodily harm to or endangers the bodily safety of another person by consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his or her act or omission will cause harm or endanger the safety of the other person and the disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation is guilty of a misdemeanor.” Michael Bixon, a longtime Atlanta defense attorney who is not affiliated with the Patterson case, said he sees the reckless-conduct law most often applied in cases of gunfire or the conscious spread of HIV. In a phone interview, he said the Patterson case was “a complete misuse and a stretch of the statute.” It was not the first time authorities used this law in relation to parenting. In 1997, the Georgia Supreme Court heard the case of Rosalind Hall, a woman in west-central Georgia who left her 11-year-old son to watch three younger children. The 3-year-old died of a head injury. Hall was charged with and convicted of reckless conduct. But in a 4-3 opinion, the high court overturned the conviction. The justices wrote that the statute as applied in that case “lacks definite and explicit standards to guide its enforcement, thereby making it susceptible to arbitrary and selective enforcement by police, prosecutors, and juries.” One day 27 years later, roughly five hours after she found the boy in Mineral Bluff, Deputy Kaylee Robertson went to a magistrate and swore out a warrant for Brittany Patterson. She said Patterson committed reckless conduct for “knowingly leaving the residence” while her son “was missing from the residence and did not report it to law enforcement.” Minutes after that, with daylight fading, she knocked on the door of the Patterson house. While handcuffed outside her house, Patterson told the deputy that she didn’t think it was illegal “for a kid to walk to the store.” “It is when they’re 10 years old,” Deputy Robertson said. Patterson was astounded. “Itis?” she said. “Yes,” said Robertson. “Okay,” Patterson said. “I’d like to see that on the books.” “Okay,” Robertson said. “Well, you’ll see it on your warrant.” Nothing like this was actually on the warrant. But Patterson had no way of knowing that, and no way out of the handcuffs, so she complied. She called to her son, the one whose spontaneous walk had started all this, and told him to call her mother. The boy did as he was told. He stood in the doorway, called his grandmother and put her on speakerphone. With hands cuffed behind her back, Patterson leaned toward the phone. “Uh, the police are here and they’re taking me to jail,” she said. “So I need you to come stay with the kids.” Her mother said she’d be there in five minutes. Patterson was angry and confused, but she knew that making a scene wouldn’t help her kids. So she decided to play it cool. When a daughter appeared, Patterson said, “They’re takin’ me to jail.” She said it as casually as if she were leaving for the grocery store. “I love you,” the girl said, and gave her mother a kiss. Sound of crickets, falling dusk, orange leaves, pale sunset. Another child appeared. “Call Daddy and tell him they’re takin’ me to jail,” Patterson said. “Marmie’ll be here in a minute.” She seemed to almost smile as she walked toward the cruisers. One of the kids asked when she would be back. “Who knows,” Patterson said, in a tone that suggested this might be an adventure. Deputy Henry led her to the back of his cruiser. Then he buckled her seat belt, as a parent would do for a small child. At the jail in Blue Ridge, she had to change into orange scrubs and submit to fingerprinting. But she was only there for about an hour. The sheriff called and said she could leave on a $500 property bond. Her mother and sister picked her up. She went home and hugged her children. It’s not clear what will happen next in the case, though it seems unlikely she’ll be sent back to jail. On the recorded call, the prosecutor said, “I wasn’t planning on filing an accusation because DFCS is putting a safety plan in place.” But that proposal from the Georgia Division of Family & Children Services would require Patterson to put an app on her son’s phone to monitor his location. She does not intend to do that. Her attorney, David DeLugas, is executive director of ParentsUSA, a nonprofit that advocates for parents’ rights. He says that in this case, simply dropping the charge won’t be enough. He wants a full exoneration. Patterson has had several weeks to think about the incident. Aside from the criminal accusation, there was also the subtext. The implication that she was a bad mother. And that hurt. For the last 16 years, she said, most of the time of most of her days had been devoted to her children. She had sacrificed her career. Missed out on time alone with her husband. Turned down invitations to visit with friends or go to parties. So much of her life was driving. Wrestling matches. Gymnastics competitions. Band concerts. She lived for those kids. As her attorney gathered investigative materials to prepare her defense, Patterson got a rare opportunity. On the body-camera footage, she got to see what her own mother said about her when she wasn’t around. Her mother had been critical of her in the past — house not clean enough, kids not well-behaved enough — and now, moments after the arrest, she stood before Deputy Robertson without knowing she was being recorded. “Well,” Patterson’s mother said, “she could lose her way of making of living by being arrested, you do realize that.” “Okay, that’s not my concern,” the deputy said. “My concern is the children.” “Yeah,” the grandmother said. “The children are fine. The children have a good mother.”","Society, Politics"
How a teenager’s holiday romance led to prison time in Dubai,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/middleeast/dubai-uae-romance-jail-intl-hnk/,"Holiday romances are the stuff of rom-coms and chick-lit — but not for 18-year-old Marcus Fakana, who is facing a one-year prison sentence for his summer fling. The construction apprentice from London was on holiday with his family in Dubai in September when he met a fellow British teenager at his hotel, and they began a romantic relationship that became sexual. The pair planned to continue their budding connection in London. But when the 17-year-old girl returned to the United Kingdom, her mother discovered the relationship and reported Fakana to Dubai police. “It was very traumatic. I was taken from the hotel without being told why. I wasn’t allowed to call anyone, including my parents,” Fakana told CNN in a written statement shared by his legal advisory team,Detained in Dubai. “Everything was in Arabic and I didn’t know when I would get out. I wasn’t given access to a lawyer, the embassy, or my parents.” The age of consent in the United Arab Emirates – of which Dubai is the biggest city – is 18, making the girl a minor at the time of her relationship with Fakana. “I did not intend to break the law, I didn’t even know she was one month away from being 18,” says Fakana, adding he didn’t consider age an issue as they were in the same school year. The teenager says he’s sorry and regretful for breaking law — but is appealing to the conservative monarchy’s Prime Minister and Dubai ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, to repeal the one-year jail sentence handed down to him last week, “to let me go home for Christmas with my family.” Dubai is popular withWestern Europeantravelers, who flock to the beach-side city for its warm climate and luxury lifestyle. The city hosted arecord 17.15 million international visitorslast year, and its airport served 87 million passengers, making it thesecond-busiest in the world. But most travelers are unaware of how different the authoritarian nation’s legal system is, being based on both civil and Sharia law. Dubai has marketed itself as a “modern and liberal tourist destination,” which can be “confusing for tourists” when they come up against little-known laws or the arbitrary application of them, says Radha Stirling, CEO and founder of Detained in Dubai, a UK-based legal advisory and human rights organization. As a result, Fakana’s case is just the latest example of a foreigner in trouble in the City of Gold. Legislation around relationships, alcohol and online activity are some of the issues tourists most commonly run into. While alcohol consumption is legal in licensed venues in Dubai, and party culture is “widespread,” anyone caught with alcohol in their system in a public place can be charged with public drunkenness or consuming alcohol without a license, says Stirling. “No one would think that it’s illegal to leave a venue, get in a taxi, and go home – but while you’re outside the venue, you’re violating the law,” she adds. Another area of confusion is the nation’s sweepingcybercrime laws, which cover online activity from hacking and terrorism tounfriendly commentsandpromoting charities. These laws apply to private and public communications, retroactively and internationally — so something you share online before you travel to the UAE can still lead to prosecution after you arrive, says Stirling. “I’d say almost 100% of visitors to the UAE are already in violation of those laws, if someone made the effort to report them,” she says. This year, a39-year-old Irishmanwas detained in Dubai for three months over sending a “threatening emoji,” and a Northern Irish man was detained for two months over anegative Google review. Dubai police and its government media office did not reply to requests for comment from CNN. While the UAE has one of the highest rates offoreign prisonersin the world — not surprising given its population is around 90% non-Emirati — Stirling says most of those detained in the UAE do not end up serving prison time. The strict application of these laws is necessary to maintain public safety and security, says Azaan Salahuddin, managing partner at Dubai-based law firm Al Adl Legal. “Laws are meant to protect citizens, or people coming in from outside the country,” he says. He pointed to the nation’s low crime rate: in Dubai, official police figures recorded just24.6 crimes per 100,000 peoplein 2023. This is significantly lower than the UK’s rate – measured on a different ratio entirely – of84 per 1,000 people. “Every country that I’ve been to enforces their laws,” says Salahuddin, adding that ignorance is not an excuse and it’s each traveler’s responsibility to know the law. In Fakana’s case, “it is clear that the girl was under the age of consent and her parents have cast charges,” he says. “It’s a simple case.” UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who is also the member of parliament for Fakana’s constituency, Tottenham, echoed these sentiments: “It is the case wherever you are in the world – and that’s why the Foreign Office makes clear on itswebsitewhat the rules are – that you follow the rules and the law according to that country.” A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he “recognizes it’s an extremely distressing situation for Marcus and his family,” and that the Foreign Office “is in regular contact with his family and his legal team at this difficult time.” But other foreigners have also found the UAE’s legal system, and many caveated laws, confusing. In July this year, Tori Towey, a 28-year-old Irish flight attendant for Dubai-based airline Emirates, was facing six months in prison for attempting suicide and consuming alcohol. Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters.In the US: Call or text 988, theSuicide & Crisis Lifeline.Globally: TheInternational Association for Suicide PreventionandBefrienders Worldwidehave contact information for crisis centers around the world. Towey, who lived in Dubai for one year, says her partner became physically abusive after they moved in together. She reported the domestic violence to the police, but her partner made a retaliatory case against her, resulting in a travel ban that prevented her from working or leaving the country. “The police told me that if I dropped the case, my travel ban would be lifted,” Towey says. But this didn’t happen. “That just put me in a really bad situation. I had nowhere to go. I had to go back to him. I just felt like I was just stuck, like there was no help,” she told CNN in a phone interview. After attempting to take her own life in May this year, Towey found herself at the police station facing charges of attempted suicide. In the UAE, suicide is illegal, despite awidely publicized announcement in 2020that it would be decriminalized. “I had to find out for myself what the charges were, because I wasn’t told,” she says. Finding legal representation was difficult, too. “Lawyers won’t even look at your case without 20,000 dirhams (about $5,400) up front.” Towey finally got legal advice from Detained in Dubai, and with mounting pressure from the Irish government and the media spotlight on her story, her two-month travel ban was finally lifted, the charges were dropped, and she was able to return home. Before the incident, Towey says she was happy in Dubai, and still has a lot of love for the city and culture she left behind. “It’s just the system and the stress that it can cause. It can break you, because you can lose everything,” she says. Meanwhile, Fakana’s parents had to return to the UK for work, and he remains in Dubai, alone. “I’ve been here for four months and it’s been stressful and financially draining,” he says. “I’ve been without a family for a long time, suffering anxiety, headaches, and sleepless nights.” Stirling believes Fakana’s case should have been tried at the court of misdemeanors, alleging that the police incorrectly stated his age as 19 and his nationality as Pakistani in their report, which she says likely led to a harsher judgment. Fakana and his lawyers are now deciding whether to appeal hisone-year sentence in Dubai Central Prison, a jail with a poor record forhuman rights abuses and torture— although there’s a chance the prosecution will seek an even harsher sentence. “I heard they could give me a fine and deportation instead and I am pleading for that,” Fakana says. “It’s been an eye-opener; this has been the most stressful time of my entire life.”","World, Society"

The US still has not had a woman leader – here are the countries that have,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/world/women-global-leaders-countries-dg/,"This year, 45 countries in the United Nations held national elections to decide their top leadership. Of those, only four selected a woman to become head of state or government, according to CNN’s analysis of International Foundation for Electoral Systems data. While the US had the opportunity to elect its first female president, voters who hoped to see the glass ceiling broken saw a defeat for the second time in eight years. Three of the countries that picked a female leader in 2024 – North Macedonia, Namibia and Mexico – did so for the first time in their nation’s history. In the post-World War II period, the first woman was elected to lead a UN country 64 years ago. Here’s a look at where, and when, women have secured national leadership positions since then. It wasn’t until the past two decades that many more countries saw their first female leaders, according to CNN’s analysis of the Council on Foreign Relations’Women’s Power Index, which includes UN member states and excludes monarchs, monarch-appointed leaders and chairpersons of collective governments. Forty-nine UN member states have had one female leader in the last seven decades. Another 18 countries have had two female leaders, nine countries have had three female leaders, and just two countries – Finland and Iceland – have been headed by four different female leaders. Still, a woman has never served as head of state or government in 115 UN member countries. The first continent with a UN member state to have a female leader after WWII was Asia. In 1960, Sri Lanka – known then as Ceylon – elected its first female prime minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She entered politics after her husband was assassinated while serving as prime minister. Since then, women have led 13 other countries in Asia. A lot of them came into politics through their husbands or fathers, in former colonial countries. “Many of the earliest women to come to power were those with dynastic connections to power, and in places where the dynastic connection was tied very closely to the struggle for independence,” said Minna Cowper-Coles, research fellow at the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership at King’s College London. Asia also leads when it comes to women’s tenure in power, with Sheikh Hasina holding the record for the highest number of years served by a woman as a national leader. Hasina was prime minister of Bangladesh from 1996 to 2001, and again from 2009 untilher resignation in August 2024following massive anti-government protests. Her father, an independence leader, was Bangladesh’s first prime minister. Isabel Perón was the first female head of state in the Americas. Her husband, Juan Perón, was president of Argentina and died in office in 1974. As the vice president, she took over many of his duties when he became ill, and was sworn in to the presidency after his death. In October, Claudia Sheinbaum was inaugurated as the first female president of Mexico. The first woman to become leader of an African country was Elisabeth Domitien, who was appointed prime minister of the Central African Republic in 1975. The first elected female head of state in Africa was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who became president of Liberia in 2006. In 2021, Tunisia became the first Arab country to be governed by a woman, when Najla Bouden was appointed prime minister by the country’s president. Margaret Thatcher became Europe’s first female prime minister in 1979. A few months later, Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo of Portugal became the continent’s second female head of government. Since 2010, 28 countries in Europe have had at least one female leader, and the region now has the highest proportion of countries to have had a female leader. Around two-thirds, or 65%, of the 43 UN member countries in the region have had a female leader, and just under a quarter of them are currently being led by a woman. European female leaders have also achieved significant tenure, with five leaders in the top 10 for longest time served, all with over 10 years in office. Angela Merkel, who first became Germany’s chancellor in 2005, held the role for 16 years. Jenny Shipley was the first female prime minister of New Zealand, serving from 1997 to 1999. Julia Gillard was the first woman to hold the title of prime minister of Australia, serving from 2010 to 2013. Experts say it’s important for women to play key roles in government because it broadens representation. “We know that there is some sort of power to seeing people like you represented. That matters,” said Farida Jalalzai, associate dean for global initiatives and engagement and professor of political science at Virginia Tech, in an interview with CNN prior to the US election. “You see more examples of diverse people in these roles, whether they’re nominees, whether they’re presidents, whether they’re prime ministers, and it breaks down conceptions of what we think those leaders should look like.” One possible positive outcome of women winning elections around the world is that their success may inspire others to go for leadership roles, encouraging younger generations of women into politics. “We can talk about the power of recruitment,” Jalalzai said. “If a woman wins, maybe then we’ve learned the lesson that a woman can win… so you end up finding more women who are willing to throw their hats in the ring.” ﻿Methodology The Council on Foreign Relations maintains an index of UN member states and their progress towards gender parity in political participation since 1946. Its database includes whether a woman is currently, or ever has been, head of state or government and was last updated on Dec. 9, 2024. CNN updated that list using additional research. This data does not count: monarchs or governors appointed by monarchs; acting or interim heads of state or government who were not subsequently elected or confirmed; honorary heads of state or government; joint or collective heads of state or government, and chairpersons or presiding members thereof. As a result, female leaders for Switzerland and Bosnia and Herzegovina are excluded. Kosovo, although it has a female president, is not a UN member state, so the country is excluded","Politics, World"
"Blake Lively accuses Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment, which he denies",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/entertainment/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-complaint/,"Blake Lively has accused her “It Ends With Us” costar and director Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment and retaliation in a civil rights complaint, alleging he and his team designed a “plan” to “destroy” her reputation. In a complaint filed with the California Civil Rights Department on Friday and obtained byThe New York Times, Lively claims that during filming of “It Ends With Us,” a meeting was held to address a “hostile work environment that had nearly derailed production.” Lively raised concerns about “repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior by Mr. Baldoni.” The complaint states that her husband, actor and producer Ryan Reynolds, was present at the meeting, serving as Lively’s chosen representative. According to the complaint, the parties “discussed in detail the inappropriate conduct that Ms. Lively, her employees and other cast and crew experienced at the hands of Mr. Baldoni” and a producer for the film, Jamey Heath. They agreed at the time that Lively and employees would no longer be shown nude videos or images of women, there would be no further mention of the pair’s purported pornography addictions, “no more descriptions of their own genitalia” and no more disparaging comments would be made to Lively or her employees, per the complaint. They also agreed that an intimacy coordinator would be present at all times when Lively was on set in scenes with Baldoni. The complaint also includes screen captures of text messages and correspondence, obtained by Lively’s legal team in discovery, that they argue show orchestrated attempts on the part of Baldoni’s PR representatives to hurt her reputation in the media as part of a “social manipulation campaign.” “It Ends With Us” is based on Colleen Hoover’s hit 2016 novel of the same name and centers around domestic violence in a couple, which was portrayed on-screen by Lively and Baldoni. The complaint, a precursor to a lawsuit, names Baldoni as a defendant, as well as his production company Wayfarer Studios, his publicist, Heath and a crisis public relations manager, among others. Lively, also a producer on the film, “seeks to set the record straight, to hold the Wayfarer Parties and Associates accountable, and to shine a light on this new form of retaliation so that it will not be used against any others who seek to stand up and speak out against sexual harassment,” according to the complaint. Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, denied the allegations in a statement to CNN. “These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,” Freedman said. “It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to ‘fix’ her negative reputation, which,” Freedman added, “was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions.” Wayfarer proactively hired a crisis PR manager, Freedman said, due to “the multiple demands and threats” made by Lively during production of the film, alleging she threatened “not showing up to set” and “to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.” Baldoni’s attorney also accused Lively’s team of planting “negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media” about Baldoni prior to the film’s release. In a statement to CNN, Lively said, “I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.” “It Ends With Us” was a commercial success, earning more than $350 million at the box office. However,reportssurfaced about creative differences andtensions on setbetween Lively and Baldoni. The two did not promote the film together and debate arose online about how theyaddressedthe issue of domestic violence – a central plot element in the film – in their individual promotional work about the movie, with Lively receiving criticism by some who viewed her messaging around the film as overly positive.",Entertainment
Female passenger killed after being set on fire on an NYC subway train,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/us/nyc-subway-fire-woman-death/,"A female passenger died after being set on fire by a man on a New York City subway train Sunday morning, according to police. Around 7:30 a.m., a man, who police believe is about 25 to 30 years old, approached the sleeping victim on a stationary F train car and intentionally set her on fire before fleeing the scene, NYPD Det. Austin Glickman told CNN. Police officers conducting a routine patrol at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station in Brooklyn encountered the victim on fire inside a subway car, Glickman said. Officials extinguished the fire, and EMS responded to the scene and pronounced the female dead, according to the detective. Police are investigating the incident as a homicide, Glickman said. The NYPD is seeking the public’s help to find the suspect, a male who is about 5 feet, 6 inches tall and 150 pounds, according to an NYPD news release. The suspect was last seen wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans, a dark-colored knit hat with a red band and brown boots, the release said. Crime Stoppers is offering up to $10,000 for information about the suspect. Identifying information about the victim is not yet available, Glickman said. No other passengers or first responders were injured in the incident, police said. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Wednesday announced efforts to bolster subway safety ahead of the holidays, deploying an additional 250 National Guard members to New York City and ensuring every subway car is outfitted with security cameras. Hochul’s office says crime is down 10% since the governor announced a subway safety plan in May and 42% since January 2021, though a number of high-profileviolent incidentsin the subway system in recent years have left some residents uneasy. The city was under a “Code Blue” alert Saturday night, when additional resources and shelter are deployed to help those vulnerable to freezing temperatures, especially homeless people, who sometimes seek shelter on the subway system during severe weather. This is a developing story and will be updated. CNN’s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.",Society
Here are 12 well-known companies that went bankrupt in 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/business/2024-company-bankruptcy-list/,"This year was brutal for a number of well-known companies and their bottom lines. As inflation continued to rear its ugly head, consumers slashed their discretionary spending, tilting some companies to file for bankruptcy. Other brands fell victim to changing trends or even more malicious ailments, like cyberattacks. At least 19 companies have cut a combined 14,000 jobs because of bankruptcies, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement services firm. Notably,retail closureshave picked up this year because the sector’ssugar highof 2021 and 2022 — when consumers were buying new furniture, televisions and clothing — has ended. There have been more than 7,100 store closures through the end of November, according to research firm CoreSight — a jump of 69% compared to the same time a year ago. Of course, filing for bankruptcy doesn’t necessarily mean a business is going bust. Companies tend to use the Chapter 11 process to wind down some operations, tackle mounting debt and save on costs by closing locations. Here are some of the most notable bankruptcies of 2024, listed alphabetically: Big Lots filed forbankruptcy in September,after previously warning that it had“substantial doubt”about its survival. The discount retailer recently announced that its deal to sell itself to a private equity firm had fallen through and it will soon close its remaining 963 locations. Perhaps best known for its late-night informercials, the at-home gym equipment makerfiled for bankruptcy in March. It emerged from Chapter 11 a few months later, signing a deal witha Taiwan-based company to “acquire substantially all of the assets” for $37.5 million in cash. The once-trendy mall staple filed forbankruptcy in Aprilafter consistently struggling with continued missteps over its merchandise mix that failed to get shoppers excited. As a result, nearly 100 locations closed and the company, which also owns theBonobosbrand, sold itself to a consortium led by WHP Global in June. The 81-year-old fabric and craft retailerfiled for bankruptcyin March, falling victim to customers cutting back on spending, including on fabric, arts and supplies materials. Joann’s stock was delisted from the Nasdaq and the company became privately owned, slashing its debt and keeping all 850 stores open. The home retailer formerly known asLumber Liquidatorsfiled for bankruptcy in August. The retailer was hammered by budget-conscious customers tightening their wallets on pricey remodels and a slowing home sales market. After initially announcing thecomplete closureof its 94 stores, a private equity firm bought and saved the company. The four-decade-old retailerfiled for bankruptcyin December, marking its second time in less than two years. As a result, Party City willclose its roughly 700 locationsearly next year. The New Jersey-based company faced inflationary pressures on product costs, which reduced consumer spending, according to CEO Barry Litwin, as well as $800 million in outstanding debt. The restaurant chain that brought affordable shrimp and lobster to middle-class America and grew to become the largest seafood restaurant chain in the world filed forbankruptcy in May. Years of underinvestment in its marketing, food quality, service and restaurant upgrades hurt the chain’s ability to compete with growing fast-casual and quick-service chains. After closing more than 100 locations, Red Lobster emerged from bankruptcy in September thanks to a new owner and leadership that’s alreadychanging the menu. The yellow-hued budget carrierlanded in bankruptcyin November because of mounting losses, unaffordable debt, increased competition and the inability to merge with other airlines. Spirit said that because of its bankruptcy and negotiations with existing creditors, it will be able to emerge early next year with reduced debt and increased financial flexibility. Stoli Group USA, the owner of thenamesake vodka,filed for bankruptcy in December. A number of things went wrong for the unit, including a slowing demand for spirits, a major cyberattack that snarled its operations and several years of fighting Russia in court. The American casual dining chain known for its “flair” filed forChapter 11 in Novemberafter years of dealing with a shrinking footprint and a decline in customers. TGI Fridays said in a statement that fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic was the “primary driver of our financial challenges” and that it will use the process to “explore strategic alternatives in order to ensure the long-term viability of the brand.” The 75-year-old hardware store brand filed forbankruptcy in Octoberand ended its legacy by substantially selling its operations to a rival. In court filings, True Value said it faces a significant cash crunch as the housing market has stalled and consumers have become far more picky about discretionary purchases like hardware. (True Value stores are still open because they are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings). The kitchen brand, known for its plastic food storage containers,filed for bankruptcy in Septemberafter years of falling popularity and financial troubles. In late November, Tupperware’s brand name and intellectual property were bought by a private equity firm that aims to keep the company operational.",Business
German city is in shock as anti-immigrant anger rises after deadly market attack,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/europe/anti-immigrant-anger-magdeburg-market-attack-intl/,"Its glühwein stalls, festooned with Christmas lights and tinsel, stand emptied and shuttered. On the cordoned off market street, in the center of Magdeburg, German police stand guard as, one officer told CNN, forensic teams carefully examine the crime scene before scrubbing the blood stains from the road. The horrificcar-ramming attackon this Christmas market on Friday night left at least five people dead, including a 9-year-old boy, plunging this provincial German city into shock. At the entrance to the market, grieving locals have lit candles and laid flowers to pay their respects, many feeling a profound sense of loss. “I’ve seen a lot of misery, many people who were searching. Many tears, bewilderment and extreme states of shock,” said Corinna Pagels, an emergency psychological counselor offering help to those affected. Amid the grief, the attack has revived memories in Germany of a similar assault in 2016, when more than a dozen people were mowed down and killed at a Christmas market in Berlin. Back then, it was a 24-year-old Tunisian man, who had failed to gain asylum in Germany and pledged allegiance to the radical jihadists of ISIS, who plowed a truck through the festive crowd, fueling anger and suspicion across Germany towards a recent influx of mainly Muslim immigrants from the Middle East. This time, thesuspectis very different. Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, 50, was originally from Saudi Arabia, but had lived in Germany since 2006, working as a consultant psychiatric doctor in a local clinic. He is also an avowed atheist and anti-Islam, once describing himself in a 2019 newspaper interview as “the most aggressive critic of Islam in history.” On social media, Abdulmohsen expressed support for the German anti-immigration AfD party and repeated his own frustrations with what he saw as the German government’s soft line on immigration, as well as what he believed was Berlin’s overly cordial relationship with the Saudi regime. Recent messages included threats. In August, Abdulmohsen said that if Germany “wants to kill us, we will slaughter them, die, or go to prison with pride.” A constant in his feed was his anger at Islam. Germany, Abdulmohsen claimed, wanted “to Islamize Europe.” But for many Germans in Magdeburg, the fact the latest Christmas market attacker doesn’t fit the expected security profile simply doesn’t matter. “Our politicians are responsible for this,” one local woman, Barbara, told CNN as she paid her respects outside the police cordons. “I think there should be a clean-up of people who do these things,” she added. “Now is time to close our borders,” said a local man, Tom, standing nearby. German politicians from opposite ends of the political spectrum have seized on the car-ramming to attack the coalition government. Both share an opposition to mass migration: Far-left party leader Sahra Wagenknecht asked Interior Minister Nancy Faeser “why so many tips and warnings were ignored beforehand.” Meanwhile the far-right AfD – which has made significant ground this year – is organizing a rally in Magdeburg on Monday evening, and the party’s parliamentary chief has demanded on X a special session be called to discuss security matters in the wake of the attack. It seems this horrific and deadly Christmas market attack, despite allegedly being committed by a self-confessed Islamophobe, is fueling Germany’s angry anti-immigration mood.",World
Drones continue to buzz over US bases. The military isn’t sure why or how to stop them,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/politics/drones-us-military-bases/,"A series ofdrone sightingsover military bases across the country has renewed concerns that the US doesn’t have clear government-wide policy for how to deal with unauthorized incursions that could potentially pose a national security threat. “We’re one year past Langley drone incursions and almost two years past the PRC spy balloon. Why don’t we have a single [point of contact] who is responsible for coordination across all organizations in the government to address this?” the recently retired head of US Northern Command and NORAD, Gen. Glen VanHerck, told CNN. “Instead, everybody’s pointing their fingers at each other saying it’s not our responsibility.” Indeed, there have been multiple instances of drone incursions over military bases since mysterious drone swarms were spotted around Joint Base Langley-Eustis and other sensitive military sites in Virginia last year, and since aChinese spy balloontransited the continental US in 2023. Over a period of six days earlier this month, there were six instances of unmanned aerial systems, or drones, entering the airspace of the Marine Corps base Camp Pendleton in California, a spokesperson confirmed to CNN, adding that they posed “no threat to installation operations and no impact to air and ground operations.” There have also been incidents in the last month at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio; Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey; Naval Weapons Station Earle, New Jersey; and Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. A Chinese citizen, who is a lawful permanent resident of the US, was recently arrested in connection to the California incident. The drone incidents are “a problem that has been brewing for over a decade and we have basically failed to address it,” said retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Rob Spalding, who previously served as the chief China strategist for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and senior director for strategic planning on the National Security Council. It’s unclear what specifically the drones could be doing — the intent could be anything from attempting to gather intelligence on the base or testing its defenses and response time, to gaining a better understanding of how the bases work, or they could simply be harmless hobbyists flying drones too close to restricted areas. But the issue isn’t just impacting military installations;in recent weeks, a flurry of drone sightings across multiple states has garnered media attention and led politicians to call for the government to take action. Officials have stressed that they don’t believe the drones spotted in New Jersey and other states pose a national security or public safety risk, attributing many of the sightings to explainable instances of confusion with manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters or hobbyist drones. “I can’t rule out the fact that we might find some sort of illegal or criminal activity, some nefarious activity, (but) all I can do is tell you that right now we see none of that,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said this week. But as one Senate aide familiar with discussions on drone defense and policy told CNN, just because the drones aren’t directly impacting the military or military installations “doesn’t mean it’s not a national security issue.” Despite the incursions and the risk they could pose, officials say there is no coordinated policy to determine what agency leads the response to such activity, or how to determine where the drones originate. CNNreported this weekthat government agencies have struggled to keep pace with the development of drones and drone technology, particularly by adversaries like China, though legislation is being discussed and the Pentagon just recently releasedits strategyfor countering unmanned systems. The Senate aide said the gray area between posing a risk to the military and posing a threat to the public is part of the problem in authorities — “if it’s not strictly DOD then it must be DHS, but we just kind of go ‘round and ‘round.” The challenges the US national security establishment faces when it comes to drone operations, as well as operations in the cyber and information environments, have been pointed to repeatedly and publicly by military officials and lawmakers. In 2023, VanHerck said in a NORAD/NORTHCOM posture statement that the US must “move beyond outdated assumptions and plans” in order to defend the homeland. “In an era of incredible innovation and technological achievement, inflexible, outdated processes are a greater impediment to success than many of our competitors’ capability advancements,” he said. The two heads of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sens. Jack Reed and Roger Wicker, sounded the alarm ina Washington Post op-edat the beginning of 2024 that the US “lacks adequate drone detection capability” and that agencies “lack clear lines of authority about which agency is responsible for stopping these incursions.” Military installations have the authority to protect themselves and respond to threats, but a former senior military official said that if the drone enters the airspace and subsequently leaves, determining where the drone originated from and what it was doing can be difficult. Military law enforcement typically coordinates with civilian law enforcement off base in that instance, the former official said, but are often limited in what they can do given laws that restrict intelligence collection within US borders. But sources also said the lack of ability to do more also stems at times from a failure to prioritize defense against this kind of activity within the US. The topic is “such a relatively new phenomenon that the law has not caught up and the agencies have not adapted quickly enough,” the Senate aide said. “We’re going to get there, but it’s a pretty surprising gap that can be exploited,” they said, adding that until there’s “clear leadership from the White House, this is all going to keep spinning.” Experts also pointed to what they described as a generalized belief in the US that conflict primarily happens abroad, and that the national security establishment hasn’t adjusted quickly enough to threats at home. Spalding said the US has been “focused on the away game, which has left us incredibly vulnerable at home as technology has advanced.” “We have a perception that the fight will occur elsewhere, that a fight with China will happen in the South China Sea or Taiwan, or with Russia in Europe. It’s happening right now — in the cyber domain or information space — every single day here,” VanHerck told CNN. The former senior military official said that over the years, a number of senior military commanders have testified before Congress about gaps in domain awareness in the US and limitations on the US’ ability to detect drones and more broadly defend the homeland. And while lawmakers generally seem receptive, and to understand the problem, that understanding hasn’t been reflected in policy, the official said. The need for Congressional action was made clear in a joint statement this week from the DoD, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigations and Federal Aviation Administration. The agencies said they “urge Congress to enact counter-UAS legislation when it reconvenes that would extend and expand existing counter-drone authorities to identify and mitigate any threat that may emerge.” “[The drone issue] is not something we can deal with at scale anytime soon,” Spalding said, “unless we can raise the alarm at a much higher level and deal with the political repercussions of the fallout.”",Politics
Police identify driver who crashed into Texas mall before being shot by officers,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/us/killeen-mall-texas-crash/,"Police have identified the man they said drove into a Texas mall Saturday after a 19-mile police pursuit, striking four people before he was fatally shot by responding law enforcement officers. John Darrel Schultz, 53, of Kempner, Texas, has been identified as the suspect, Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Bryan Washko confirmed to CNN on Sunday. The chase began when a Texas Highway Patrol trooper tried to stop a pickup truck around 5 p.m. CT in the Belton area after authorities got a call about the driver possibly being intoxicated, Washko said at a Saturday news conference. The suspect exited the highway and entered the Killeen Mall parking lot, where he drove through the glass doors of a JCPenney store’s main entrance during the busy holiday shopping season, according to Washko. The suspect “drove through the doors and continued to travel through the JCPenney store, striking multiple people,” he said. Law enforcement officers shot and killed Schulz after the chase,Washko said. The truck traveled “several hundred yards” through the store as troopers and local police followed on foot and “engaged in gunfire to eliminate this threat,” Washko said. Four people were injured by the pickup truck as it drove through the mall and were taken to a hospital while a fifth person went to the hospital on their own, Washko said. The victims range in age from 6 to 75 years old. “There’s people in here shopping for their families, their children, their friends, loved ones, and these kinds of things we don’t like to see, obviously, and we pray for their recovery,” Washko said of the victims. Two off-duty officers who were at the mall with their families were among the law enforcement who opened fire to stop the driver, Washko said. “It’s unfortunate that this has happened, and our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this incident,” a Killeen Mall spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Our priority is the safety and well-being of our employees and guests. As the investigation is ongoing, we cannot provide any further comments.” The mall reopened at 1 p.m. Sunday and will close at 8 p.m. before returning to normal holiday hours. Nathan Carrasco told CNN he was in his car with his friends in the Killeen Mall parking lot when they witnessed a truck drive through the JCPenney door and run over people. Carrasco said two police vehicles chased the truck in the parking lot, and just before officers nearly cornered the truck, the truck drove through the department store. Carrasco and his friends jumped out of the car to make sure everyone was OK, he said. Related live-storyAt least 2 dead and dozens injured in attack on German Christmas market, authorities say “There were people lying on the floor with glass everywhere,” Carrasco said, adding people rushed into the store to help a woman and a young girl who was bleeding. Catherine Dedden told CNN her dashcam partially captured the police chase on a nearby highway, which runs adjacent to the mall, while she was in the mall parking lot. “We turned around in the parking lot and the chase was in front of us,” Dedden said, adding she did not see the truck crash into the mall but saw an officer tend to a young girl. “I saw a little girl being carried by a police officer,” Dedden said. “Her head was bleeding; she was shaking. I asked if there was anything I could do to help. The officer was shaken, his full attention was on the child as he bandaged her. They took her into the ambulance.” Rose and Will Parker told CNN they were near the coffee shop near the JCPenney when they heard several gunshots and saw people running. “I grabbed my wife, and we went into the coffee shop. We locked up in a back room,” Will Parker said. They were in the coffee shop for about 15 minutes when a security guard escorted them out of the mall. “It was a mess,” Parker said. “I’m thankful to the gentleman, the security guy, that helped us out.” Killeen is about 70 miles north of Austin and is home to the Army’s Fort Cavazos, formerly Fort Hood.

Chiefs dispatch Texans in game marred by gruesome injury; Ravens clinch playoff berth,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/sport/chiefs-texans-tank-dell-steelers-ravens-spt/,"The Kansas CityChiefsare one step closer to securing the No. 1 seed in the AFC following a 27-19 victory over the HoustonTexanson Saturday at Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri. Meanwhile, the BaltimoreRavensclinched a playoff berth following a 34-17 home win over their AFC North rival PittsburghSteelers. The first game of the NFL’s doubleheader featured the Chiefs hosting the Texans. The game was marred by a scary moment in the third quarter with the score 17-10 Chiefs. After an incredible catch on a 30-yard touchdown pass from C.J. Stroud to bring the Texans to within one, Houston wide receiver Tank Dell remained down clutching his left knee. Replays showed that Dell’s leg appeared to bend in an awkward direction after it was pinned under teammate Jared Wayne in a tangle of bodies as he made the catch. The normally raucous Arrowhead Stadium fell silent as medical personnel attended to Dell on the field. Numerous Texans players were in tears, with close friend Stroud appearing particularly distraught. Dell was taken on the field on a cart with his injured leg in a vacuum splint. The NBC broadcast later revealed that the second-year receiver was taken by ambulance to the University of Kansas Hospital, a level-one trauma center. After the game, Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said Dell sustained a “significant” knee injury, adding that he would be staying in Kansas City overnight for further evaluations. “We’re a family, we’re in this thing together and Tank means so much to our entire football team, outside of playing, just the person and the man. He means a lot to us,” Ryans said. According to NFL Networks’ Ian Rapoport, citing unnamed sources, Dell suffered a dislocated knee cap. Dell was having one of his best games of the season on Saturday, with 6 catches for 98 yards to go along with his touchdown. Following the injury any momentum that the Texans might’ve had was gone. “It’s not easy, you know what I’m saying? But after that, I tried to use it as motivation,” Stroud said. “It’s not easy to just let it go, especially since that’s my best friend. Not easy to move on and just keep playing, but I tried to do as best I could.” Patrick Mahomes, who was questionable all week with anankle injury, showed minimal signs of being affected by the high ankle sprain he suffered in the fourth quarter of the team’s victory against the Cleveland Browns last Sunday. Mahomes and the Chiefs offense wasted no time getting on the board to start the game, marching down the field for an 11-play, 66-yard drive that finished with Mahomes scrambling for a 15-yard touchdown to give the Chiefs a 7-0 lead after the successful extra point attempt. After the Dell injury, Mahomes found wide receiver Xavier Worthy just outside the endzone for the 8-yard score to all but seal the victory at 24-16 Chiefs. Both teams exchanged field goals in the fourth quarter but the Texans could not come up with another score. With the victory, the Chiefs improved to 14-1 on the season and moved closer towards a first-round bye in the playoffs. Kansas City can clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC on Sunday, if the Buffalo Bills lose or tie against the New England Patriots. If the Bills win, the Chiefs can secure it with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day. Meanwhile, the Texans will host the Baltimore Ravens also on December 25. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson passed for 207 yards and three touchdowns, while running back Derrick Henry rushed for 162 yards as Baltimore defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers,34-17. Saturday night’s contest at M&T Bank Stadium was closely fought throughout. After the Steelers tied it at 17-17 midway through the third quarter, the Ravens scored 17 unanswered points to pull away. Arguably the turning point in the game came early in the fourth quarter when Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick picked off Jackson at the Steelers own 35-yard line. Trailing 24-17, with a chance to tie the game following the turnover, Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson threw a costly interception to Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey, who took it to the house for the 37-yard pick-six touchdown. Humphrey’s interception proved to be the decisive score as the Ravens defeated the Steelers for just the second time over the last 10 meetings between the two teams. With the victory, the Ravens clinched a playoff berth, while denying the Steelers from securing the division crown. Both AFC North rivals now sit atop the division tied with a 10-5 record.",Sports
Oleksandr Usyk beats Tyson Fury again as highly anticipated rematch goes the distance,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/sport/oleksandr-usyk-beats-tyson-fury-spt-intl/,"Oleksandr Usyk defeated Tyson Fury in their hotly anticipated rematch to defend his unified heavyweight world titles in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Saturday. The pair first fought in May of this year with Usyk taking thewinvia split decision. This was the firstlossof Fury’s career and the British boxer instantly called for a rematch, setting the wheels in motion for a repeat of thebox-officeheavyweight clash. Fury was criticized for his approach during the first fight and looked much improved during the rematch at Kingdom Arena. “The Gypsy King” made more of his height advantage as he attempted to keep the smaller, faster Usyk at bay. But as seen through much of his career, when Usyk’s opponents tire, the Ukrainian seemingly grows in strength. He asserted control of the fight in the later rounds and as Fury began to run out of steam, Usyk capitalized on his advantage. Overall, Usyk landed 179 of 423 punches thrown (42%), a much higher percentage than Fury who landed 144 of his 509 punches thrown (28%), according to AP. As the fight neared its conclusion, Fury tried to land a decisive blow to end the bout, but Usyk thwarted the 36-year-old’s efforts. The Ukrainian won the fight 116-112 on all three of the judges’ scorecards – much to the displeasure of the Fury camp. “I was quite confident, I fought I won that fight again,” Fury told reporters after losing the second fight of his career. “I thought I’d won the both fights but then again, I’ve gone home with two losses on my record now so there’s not much I can do about it … I will always believe until the day I die, I’ve won that fight.” Fury admitted that this can happen in the world of boxing and that he was not “going to cry over spilled milk,” but the former heavyweight champion maintained he felt hard done by. Fury, who entered the ring to Mariah Carey’s smash Christmas hit “All I Want for Christmas Is You” and dressed like Santa Claus, said the win must have been an early Christmas present for Usyk. “I felt a little bit of Christmas spirit in there and I think he got a little Christmas gift from them judges. Christmas gift early.” When asked if Usyk was the best boxer he’d faced, Fury was also defiant in his response. “Not really to be fair. In that fight there, he never hurt me once,” Fury said. Frank Warren, Fury’s promoter, was equally as surprised by the decision. “I’m dumbfounded at how that scoring can be, it’s dreadful,” Warren told reporters. Usyk responded by calling Warren a “crazy man,” after saying he must also be blind. He added that he “wanted to rest” now, turn off his phone, “not think about boxing … and just play with my children.”",Sports
Why are teens losing their minds about college applications? One senior thinks she knows why,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/health/college-admissions-videos-social-media-wellness/,"Editor’s note:Mary Frances Ruskell is a senior at Heathwood Hall Episcopal School in Columbia, South Carolina. I spent my freshman year of high school despairing that I hadn’t invented a synthetic human heart, launched a tech start-up, written an opera or raised $10 million for charity. I ran track, sang in a cathedral choir and taught little kids how to kayak in the school’s outdoor club. I was plenty busy. Where in the world had I gotten the idea that I was supposed to be doing those other things to get into college? Why did I think that I was running out of time — at age 14? Related articleHow teens view social media’s impact on their mental health I’ve heard a lot about how social media creates unrealistic beauty standards, body images and lifestyle expectations among teenagers. But there’s another form of comparison egged on by social media: over-the-top extracurricular activities. The pressure I’ve felt to create a nonprofit and invent a solar-powered car that can drive underwater did not come from my parents or teachers despite what documentaries such as “Race to Nowhere” suggest. It came from college admission videos on social media. I don’t mean videos on essay writing tips, standardized test study hacks or the self-taped, quasi interviews attached to some applications. I’m talking about a specific subset rampant on YouTube and Instagram Reels, videos dealing only in analyses of college acceptances and rejections. The format has been perfected to keep people viewing and clicking. Related articleWhat your teen actually wants you to do when they are upset In these videos, students or, far more often, content creators outline a student’s background. They lay out their activities, grades and test scores, inevitably stellar and impressive. Then comes the hook: They outline every single school the student was rejected from, one by one, and the schools that accepted them. Often, the rejections are in big, red boxes, and the acceptances in green. The rejections are almost always shown first — lengthy lists naming Harvard, Duke and Georgetown universities and the like. Take this example: On Instagram Reels, a video posted   by @limmytalks discusses a student who has voluntarily submitted his information to this college admissions content creator. The student’s stats are impressive: He’s played piano since age 5, been in orchestra since age 10 and founded a math club tutoring other students. Intimidating but not impossible. But there’s more: The content creator @limmytalks points to the student having more than 100 million views for all online content, memorizing 1,001 digits ofpi, and holding the Guinness World Records title for solving a Rubik’s Cube upside down (called a rotating puzzle cube on the Guinness site). Literally hanging upside down, legs hooked over a bar and dangling in the air. In the video, @limmytalks takes   guesses about where the student was accepted — acceptances are in bright green letters, rejections in glaring red. The results are in the video’s caption. The student was rejected by Harvard, Yale University, Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Stanford University, the University of Southern California, New York University, Johns Hopkins University and Tulane University. He was accepted into great schools, too, such as Duke, Boston University, UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley. But his rejections were listed first. The comments are full of people despairing over their own chances. After all, there can only be one Guinness World Records holder for solving a Rubik’s Cube upside down, and if he gets rejected from so many highly selective schools, what hope is there for a “normal” student? And before you think students applying to schools with acceptance rates above 10% are spared, there are also videos touting the tagline, “Where did this AVERAGE student get in?!?” Related articleEveryone says the internet is bad for you, except these experts On Reddit, high school students post on the subreddit r/applyingtocollege, familiarly known as A2C. Kids list their “stats” and ask for feedback from Redditors on their chances of getting into particular schools. There are also videos  on platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and Instagram from students who film themselves opening emails from schools, recording their reactions in real time to rejections and acceptances. Often, their parents, siblings or friends are with them, with their reactions being filmed, too. The videos are alternately inspiring and heartbreaking. There’s something addictive about the emotional highs and lows, the shock and celebration, and the pathos of students rejected by their dream schools, choking on sobs, with their mothers at their side trying not to cry. You feel compelled to watch, and science has documented how social media leads us to compare ourselves with our peers: In theJournal of Behavioral Addictions, study authors Adele Samra, Wayne A. Warburton and Andrew M. Collins write that social media stimulates comparisons because of the abundance of content with which to compare oneself. The most damaging type of comparison is what they call “upward,” in which the subject is judged superior to oneself. These comparisons especially are linked to low self-esteem and depression, the authors noted. Related articleTeens are feeling pressured and burned out. Here’s how to help The classic example is comparisons of self to models, actors and influencers, dangers I think most people know about. But being bombarded with stats of fellow high schoolers to judge oneself against also falls into the “upward” comparison category. And when those stats are followed by a long list of rejections in bold red font, it can be devastating. The comparisons happen in school among classmates, too. The college counselor at my high school told me that she’s seen kids not apply to certain universities after hearing that fellow classmates whom they considered to be better students were applying. She also said that her students who have gone to Ivy League universities or other prestigious schools didn’t hold world records or have any other “crazy” stats. Those students took the most rigorous classes, had a mixture of service and activities inside and outside school, and worked part-time jobs. “They’re doing something significant,” she told me. “It could be like Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, could beGirls State. They may have a project. It might not be to cure cancer, but it’s a project that has changed the life of someone in the community.” What she said sounds doable. We shouldn’t all be losing our minds, right? Still, my counselor said that in over 10 years of college counseling, today’s students seem more stressed than ever before. Related articleHow internet addiction may affect your teen’s brain, according to a new study I’ve stopped watching those videos on YouTube entirely, so the algorithm quit suggesting them. Instagram, however, is a different story. It feels like there’s no escape. The videos load instantly when you’re scrolling. You don’t click on anything; they just start playing. So I began actively blocking the creators of these videos every time they came across my feed. For this article, I used other people’s Instagram accounts to view the reels, partly because most creators are blocked, but also because I didn’t want Instagram’s algorithm to think I wanted to see more of them. I learned from Kyungyong Lim, the man behind @Limmytalks, that he actually doesn’t want his videos to make kids anxious. He suggests students block him if his videos create stress. “Take what you can that’s helpful, and call it at that,” he suggested via email. Related articleIs your child headed off to college? Here are 5 tips to manage mental health Lim stumbled into the world of college admissions videos by accident. He made some TikTok videos for an internship interview process. He didn’t get the job, but discovered he enjoyed making videos and started posting, hoping to “go viral once.” He mentioned in a video that he attended Duke, and one day a student emailed and asked if Lim would read his Duke application. Lim ended up posting the kid’s application, trying to predict what the results would be, and it did go viral. After that, more high school students began sending him their applications. For Lim, the goal isn’t about going viral anymore. He said he wants to democratize the college admissions process. “It’s to the universities’ benefit to keep the admissions process vague. This way, no one questions anything,” he said, but he added he believes applicants and their families deserve to understand the process. Lim pointed out that he posts all types of applications, but “the ones that tend to go viral are the crazy ones. The average ones never reach the masses. This is just the way that human behavior works — it gravitates towards the extremes.” Related articleOverinvolved in your college kid’s life? It’s understandable but not helpful, experts say What of the high school students who find his videos panic-inducing? Don’t just watch the videos that show up on your page courtesy of an algorithm, Lim advised. “Watch other videos that you missed that are on my page,” he said. “And if all else fails, then block me.” Rationally, knowing that you’re only seeing a small, curated portion of the thousands who attend universities doesn’t completely eliminate the anxiety. I can rationalize all I like. I remind myself, from what I’ve seen of older friends who have gone through this process, that you can’t base your chances of college application success off what someone else has done. Making comparisons is useless with so many factors and such an array of activities and achievements. I know it wasn’t always this way. When my mom applied to college, she said that she just looked at a few guidebooks and picked out schools that offered merit scholarships. My dad decided to apply to colleges that looked like Welton Academy from the 1989 movie “Dead Poets Society.”They didn’t have nearly the amount of information teenagers now have, and as a result far less fear. Related articleShould the SAT still matter after all these years? Why some colleges are bringing it back Today, high schoolers can compare themselves with the entire world, not just the kid sitting at the desk next to them. We have access to the numbers, too, and admitted class profiles, SAT score spreads, acceptance rates, all just a Google search away. This information makes it seem like there should be a perfect formula for success in college admissions, but I really don’t think there is. While researching this essay, I watched a huge amount of these videos, and I realized that it doesn’t matter the stats, activities and awards that get read off — the acceptance and rejection results are impossible to predict. That realization led to another: comparing myself with the kids in these videos only led to a totally pointless regret — that I can’t go back in time to freshman year to become a different person, and even if I could, there is still no formula or perfect combination of activities I can pinpoint that guarantees acceptance. Related articleEating disorders run rampant on university campuses. How to protect your college-bound kid I don’t think there is one universal solution to this social media dilemma of comparing yourself with others. While some students find the college admission videos anxiety-producing, others see them as democratizing and helpful. My solution for my own happiness and well-being has been to just block dozens of Instagram accounts. (I had already deleted TikTok entirely.) I learned that it was the constant reminders that made me feel terrible — out of sight, out of mind. Comparing myself with others can’t and won’t change anything. I tried my hardest and submitted my best work in applying to schools. I know it’s sounds like a platitude that gets spouted often, but those efforts are really all I could do. The rest is a waiting game and out of my hands. Somehow, that’s comforting.

When Santa leaves a gun under the Christmas tree,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/us/guns-parents-kids-gifts/,"Paul Kemp, a 64-year-old who lives outside Portland, Oregon, bought his son Nathan his first rifle for his 16th birthday over a decade ago. Nathan had notched his first hunting kill, a squirrel, at age 7, and the Kemp family enjoyed their time hunting together over the ensuing years. When his son turned 16 in December 2012, Kemp believed he was responsible enough to have his own firearm. “Hunting was a family tradition. Everybody enjoyed it,” Kemp told CNN in a phone interview. “Call it, I guess, a rite of passage.” That purchase reflects a relatively common American experience: Parents buying and gifting guns to their children for their birthday or around the holiday season. For these families, a gifted gun can bring people together around a shared interest and represents an initiation into the next phase of life. “A lot of people own guns themselves and value it as part of their lives and want to pass that on to their children,” said CNN contributor Stephen Gutowski, the editor ofThe Reloadand a certified firearms instructor. Yet these days in particular,parents looking to purchase a firearm for their child for the holidays have to balance their hopes for the gift with the risks that come with such a purchase, such as an accidental shooting, suicide or the gun being used in a crime. Related articleHow US gun culture stacks up with the world For example, the teenage school shooting suspects inOxford, Michigan, andWinder, Georgia, allegedly used firearms they had received as Christmas gifts from their parents, and those parents have faced criminal charges. Police in Madison, Wisconsin, are also investigating how the 15-year-old shooter atAbundant Life Christian Schoolgained access to the firearm and whether the parents “may have been negligent,” Chief Shon Barnes said Tuesday. “But at this time, that does not appear to be the case.” “Gun ownership is something that comes with a great deal of responsibilities, in addition to being people’s rights, and those responsibilities only increase when you add children into the mix,” Gutowski said. “But there are safe ways to introduce children to firearms, and people have been doing it for generations and generations.” Paul Kemp personally learned the dangers of a gun in the wrong hands. Days after Kemp bought his son a gun, a 22-year-old man fatally shot Kemp’s brother-in-law Steve Forsyth in amass shooting at the Clackamas Town Center Mall. The killing led Kemp to become co-founder and president ofGun Owners for Responsible Ownership, a group of gun owners “who seek reasonable and responsible solutions to preventing gun violence,” according to its website. The group says it has given out thousands of lock boxes in Oregon so that people can secure their firearms safely. For Kemp, the bolt-action Ruger .22 rifle for his son was part of a family history of hunting and respect for firearms. He said he grew up hunting with his father, uncles and grandfather in Michigan, where it wasn’t uncommon to see a gutted deer in the back of a pickup truck on the highway. That firearm hobby came with responsibilities, though. “I learned at a very early age about safe firearm handling and firearm storage from my grandfather and uncles,” Kemp said. “My son learned the same safe firearm storage and handling practices from me.” In general, a parent or guardian can legally buy a firearm or ammunition as a gift for a juvenile, according to theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives(ATF). “However,” the ATF notes, “persons less than 18 years of age may only receive and possess handguns with the written permission of a parent or guardian for limited purposes, e.g., employment, ranching, farming, target practice or hunting.” State laws on the legal age for firearm possession vary, according to theGiffords Law Center, a group promoting stricter gun regulations. Some states also haveSafe Storage lawsthat require gun owners to lock up their firearms to prevent unauthorized access to children. Black Friday, with its many sales deals, is annually one of the most popular days for gun shopping. This year, there were nearly 170,000 firearms background checks initiated through theFBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System(NICS) on Black Friday – the most in one day since last year’s Black Friday. Related articleChildren and teens are more likely to die by guns than anything else There are a number of reasons parents would want to gift their child a firearm, Gutowski explained. They may want to teach their child how to hunt or shoot for sport. They may want to teach their child proper gun safety and how to properly act around firearms. Or they may want to pass on their own culture of gun ownership and self-defense to the next generation. “For the vast majority of people, it is a healthy, reasonable pursuit,” Gutowski said. “It’s something they can also share with their children, just like any other hobby or sport.” Jason Kelvie is the head coach of the Lakeville South Clay Target team in Minnesota and in that role teaches high schoolers the sport of clay target shooting. The students need a shotgun just to participate. Some use grandpa’s old shotgun, but other families without any background in firearms often come to Kelvie with questions about purchasing one for their child, he told CNN in a phone call. “(There’s) a lot of curiosity, a lot of anxiety,” he said. To them, he emphasizes the safety of the sport, noting the USA Clay Target League has had noreported injuriessince its inception in 2008 and thatfirearm safety certificationis required for all athletes. Kelvie’s own children – aged 17, 15, and 13 – all participate in the sports shooting league as well. Kelvie has purchased shotguns for their use, and he says he keeps those and other firearms secured in a safe in his garage. Hunting and shooting are family pastimes in the Kelvie clan, and a photo of an outing to the shooting range made last year’s Christmas card, he said. “It’s something we can do together, whether it’s (Clay Target) league or fun shoots or getting together with friends,” he said. “It’s entertaining, challenging and rewarding.” If not properly secured, firearms come with a range of dangers. Since 2020, firearms have become the leading cause of death for US children and teens, surpassing vehicle crashes. Firearms accounted for 18% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2022, the most recent data available fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. About 3,500 children died in gun-related incidents that year. Further, most children in the US who die from an accidental shooting are playing around with guns at home or mistaking them for toys, according to a2023 study in the scientific journal Injury Epidemiology. Failing to keep a gun secure has led to criminal charges against the parent or parents in a few cases in recent years, including in the Michigan and Georgia school shootings. Related articleParents of Michigan school shooter sentenced to 10-15 years in prison for manslaughter In the Oxford shooting, James and Jennifer Crumbley, the parents of the 15-year-old school shooter, wereconvicted of manslaughterafter prosecutors alleged they were “grossly negligent” in allowing their son to have access to the gun and ignoring signs of his spiraling mental health. They were each sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. Testimony in the trial showed James Crumbley purchased the firearm for his son on Black Friday, four days before the shooting. The next day, Jennifer Crumbley took her son to the firing range for target practice. “Mom & son day testing out his new Xmas present,” she wrote afterward on social media. The parents failed to properly secure the firearm, as James Crumbley hid it in their bedroom but did not use any locking device, the prosecution argued. In the Winder school shooting, Colin Gray, the father of the 14-year-old suspected shooter, faces charges ofmurder and manslaughterfor allegedly giving his son access to a firearm despite a warning his son would would endanger others.Investigators testifiedin court that Colin Gray bought the AR-15-style rifle allegedly used in the school shooting for his son as a Christmas present last year, only seven months after the family was questioned by law enforcement over online threats “to commit a school shooting.” Colin Gray has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his attorneys have filed motions asking to dismiss the indictment. The Michigan and Georgia cases have pushed the limits of who is responsible for a mass school shooting to include, potentially, the parent. Still, some legal experts, including the prosecutor who charged the Crumbleys, have cautioned that thesecases were unique and far outside the norm. “The vast majority of people who buy guns for their kids or teach their children to shoot are not going to end up in a negative outcome like that,” Gutowski, the CNN contributor, said.

Her surprise bestseller delivers a Christmas sermon Americans might need to hear,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/us/sharon-mcmahon-book-small-mighty-cec/,"On a cool, breezy Monday afternoon, a crowd of drunken, rowdy men gathering in the nation’s capitalstared in astonishmentas a striking figure headed toward them. It was a regal young woman riding a magnificent white horse, wearing a gold crown and a flowing white cape. The woman’s name wasInez Milholland,and on that day in March 3, 1913, she was about to make history. Dubbed the “poster girl of radicalism,”the 26-year-old was the scion of a wealthy family who had become a lawyer, a labor activist and an advocate for the poor. She was an open advocate offree love— the belief that government shouldn’t limit how women express their sexuality — and proposed to the man who would become her husband. But Milholland’s critics called her radical because she believed that all American women were entitled to vote — and she was willing to defy authorities in dramatic ways to demonstrate her beliefs. On that day, she was leading a procession of some 5,000 women through Washington for the nation’sfirst majorsuffragistparade. The men’s astonishment, though, soon turned to rage. They attacked Milholland and the marchers with curses, spitting on them and slapping some in the face. Police standing by did nothing. The only group that defended the women was a Boy Scout troop. Milholland’s flair for the dramatic and her public speaking skills helped put the suffragist movement on America’s front pages. Yet she never lived to see the ratification in 1920 of the19thAmendment,which recognized women’s right to vote. She collapsed while giving a suffragist speech in Los Angeles, “like a wilted white rose”at the podium. She suffered frompernicious anemiaand ignored warnings to ease her grueling speaking schedule. Her last public utterance was, “Mr. President, how long must women wait for their liberty?” She was 30 at the time of her death. Her life sounds like a movie, but Milholland’s crucial role in American history was eventually forgotten. Most historians preferred to focus on men on horseback leading other men into battle. ButSharon McMahon,a former high school government teacher, has resurrected Milholland and others like her in “The Small and The Mighty,” her new book that has topped the New York Times bestseller list. In her book, McMahon highlights the fortitude of citizens who changed America even though they had “the least amount of political, social and economic power.” “The best Americans are not always famous,” she writes. “They are the people who went for broke when everyone else yelled turn back. They are those who know that one becomes great because of who they lift up, not who they put down.” McMahon’s roll call of unsung heroes and heroines include: McMahon’s book, though, is more than a historical reminder — it’s a civic sermon that may inspire Americans during this turbulent time for the country. For some Americans, this holiday season brings few tidings of joy. Many have lost faith in American institutions, and a majoritybelievethe country is headed in the wrong direction. But McMahon’s book evokes the spirit of the Christmas story. The small can turn into the mighty — whether it’sa child bornin a manger to a poor, teenage mom or the unsung people that McMahon chronicles in her book. McMahon, host of the “Here’s Where It Gets Interesting” podcast, says she isn’t arguing that the rich and famous don’t make history. “My argument is that they’re not the only people that matter, as we’ve often been taught,” she tells CNN. “The small can be mighty. It’s not just the mighty who are mighty.” McMahon’s book offers two lessons for how everyday Americans today might move forward with new purpose. In an undated black-and-white photograph, an unsmiling, bespectacledVirginia Randolphstares atthe camera with a look that conveys resolve and confidence. She needed every measure of those qualities to do what she did. Randolph, a pioneering educator, is one of the characters that McMahon profiles in her book. Randolph was born to parents who had been enslaved and grew up in the Jim Crow South during an era where lynching was common and millions of Black Americans were stripped of their basic citizenship rights. Despite those obstacles, McMahon says Randolph went on to become one of America’s greatest educators, on par with Booker T. Washington, the civil rights leader who founded Tuskegee University. Randolph started off teaching Black children in a rural school that was “little more than a shack stuck in a pit of red mud.” She would go on to establish and administer schools in Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia that educated thousands of Black students. She also pioneered teaching methods used throughout America and abroad. Randolph, who never married, adopted at least 14 children (some estimates said that at least 59 children boarded with her because they couldn’t afford to pay for housing and attend school). What struck McMahon about Randolph was a credo that the educator’s mother used to repeat to her: “Do the next right thing.” It might seem easy now for some Americans to check out and give into despair because problems such as random gun violence and climate change seem insurmountable. But Randolph confronted problems like White supremacy and Jim Crow segregation that also seemed unsolvable. She never felt, though, that she had to fix everything — and neither should we, McMahon says. “A more helpful posture is to do the next needed thing before us,” she says. “I need to educate the boys and girls in front of me. I need to make soup for a sick relative.” Doing the next needed thing avoids the type of inaction that results from the belief that must rely on charismatic leaders to change America, McMahon says. “We create the kind of progress we want to see far more quickly than waiting for the right leader to be elected, “McMahon says. “Because if we’re waiting, we could be waiting for eight to 12 years. But the power to do the next needed thing is available to each one of us today.” In her day, Randolph fought against racial segregation. Today, the country is also confronting another type of segregation: ideological. Racial segregation still exists in schools and communities across America. But Americans also are self-sorting into political enclaves. We live in blue and red states. Some peoplerefuse to datesomeone of another political party. Even social media is undergoing a schism. Progressives arefleeing Elon Musk’s X, which is increasingly MAGA-friendly, and joiningBluesky,which is seen as more receptive to their views. If that all seems abstract, consider this question: When is the last time you sat down and had a calm, reflective conversation with someone who holds radically different political beliefs? It’s easy to cancel some Americans when you don’t agree with them, butSeptima Clark,one of the characters in McMahon’s book, illustrates the folly of such an approach. Clark, a civil rights activist, was surrounded by enemies. Even her civil rights allies couldn’t see her worth at times because of her gender. She has been largely lost to history because most historians focus on men like her famous colleague, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Clark, dubbed the “Mother of the Movement,” played a crucial role in securing voting rights for Black people during the Jim Crow era of the mid-20thcentury. She established citizenship schools and literacy classes throughout the South, teaching Black residents how to fill out voting registration forms. Rosa Parks participated in one of Clark’s workshops just months before she sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Clark didn’t write off her enemies. She took a magnanimous approach and was willing to engage with White segregationist and civil rights activists who discounted her. Clark explained her philosophy in one passage in McMahon’s book: “Some people slow down their growth after they become adults,” Clark said. “But you never know when a person’s going to leap forward or change around completely—I’ve seen growth like most people don’t think is possible. I can even work with my enemies because I know from experience that they might have a change of heart any minute.” You can’t change the minds of people you refuse to have contact with. It sounds so simple, but it’s often forgotten by today’s political leaders who believe the best way to win is to turn out your base and ignore or demonize your opposition. Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Obama, alluded to this attitude in arecent essay. He noted Obama was the last Democratic president since Franklin Roosevelt to twice win the majority of the popular vote — in part because of his background as a community organizer in Chicago. Community organizers spend their time talking to people who aren’t like them and don’t think like them, Favreau wrote. Obama tried hard to empathize with people even if they weren’t for him, “he made it clear that he was for them,” Favreau wrote. “That’s because organizers aren’t looking to perform for the people who already agree with them,” Favreau wrote. “They’re looking to persuade the people who don’t. They don’t just want to be right. They want to win.” The victories of the small and mighty aren’t always immediately apparent. Some of these historical figures weren’t just overlooked; they were reviled when they were alive. But their impact on America endures, McMahon says. “I love the fact that somebody at her (Milholland’s) funeral said no work for liberty is lost,” McMahon says. “It became part of the fabric of the nation. The country changes for the better because of the work of Inez Milholland.” And because of others like her as well. McMahon says Americans can do the same today — if they remember one final lesson from the small and mighty. It’s about hope. “They weren’t waiting for hope to be a feeling that descends upon us from the heavens like a beam of light,” McMahon says. “They knew that hope was a choice that they made. It was a choice to believe that things could be better. “It was a choice to believe that what they did mattered.” John Blake is a CNN senior writer and author ofthe award-winning memoir, “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”",Society
How Trump’s lawyer could steer the Supreme Court on abortion and trans rights,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/politics/john-sauer-trump-solicitor-general-profile/,"President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to be the government’s top lawyer before the Supreme Court burst on the national scene about a year ago and is best known for winning Trump immunity from prosecution for election subversion. But D. John Sauer has been an unswerving, if low-profile, foot soldier in America’s culture wars for more than a decade. The nominee for US solicitor general has opposed abortion rights, birth-control access and same-sex marriage. He backed efforts to overturn Trump’s election defeat in 2020 and last year was one of the most prominent conservatives arguing that the Biden administration censored right-wing views about Covid-19 and vaccines. Related articleAnalysis: John Roberts leads the charge to uphold bans on trans care Now, he is poised to become one of the most powerful lawyers in the country, representing the Trump administration before a conservative bench that could be even more open to the president’s agenda than the first time. Three of the nine justices were appointed by Trump during his first term. The confluence of Sauer’s experience, his personal tie to Trump and the transformed court he will face could lead to some of the most ambitious advocacy on behalf of an administration in decades. Sauer has already been at the lead of litigation over transgender rights, which was one of the flashpoints of the presidential race and at the center of the most closely watched case of the current term. Within 48 hours of Trump’s November 14 selection of Sauer for the solicitor general post, Sauer appeared on a previously scheduled Federalist Societypanelin Washington entitled “Sex, Gender, and the Law.” He spoke about a case he’d recently appealed to the Supreme Court on behalf of Arizona legislators who want to keep transgender girls and women from playing on female sports teams. (A federal appellate court blocked Arizona’s “Save Women’s Sports Act,” in the case brought by two transgender girls who wanted to play girls’ sports at their schools, finding that the prohibition violated the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.) In the general comments he offered, Sauer emphasized that lower courts are divided over the level of constitutional coverage for transgender people alleging discrimination and that legal battles are bound to continue. Earlier this month, the justices heard arguments on whether states may ban gender-affirming treatment for children experiencing gender dysphoria, that is, distress over an identity that does not match their sex at birth. The Biden administration had petitioned the justices to take the case after a US appellate court upheld bans in Tennessee and Kentucky. One of the first challenges for the new US solicitor general will be to alert the justices to a new Trump position. The incoming administration may not want to withdraw the petition or otherwise slow down the court’s consideration of the case,US v. Skrmetti, since the justices appeared ready to uphold the bans. Sauer declined a CNN interview request for this story. The 50-year-old nominee is a Harvard Law grad and Rhodes scholar who served as a law clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia and eventually became Missouri state solicitor general. He shunned the sometimes-confining world of corporate law that many lawyers of his pedigree choose. As a result, Sauer, intensely conservative and a committed Catholic, has been able to chart his own course in the law. He remained largely under the radar until the Trump representation. After his nomination, Rebecca Hart Holder, president of Reproductive Equity Now, a Boston-based national abortion rights group, raised concerns about where Sauer would take the federal government on reproductive rights, for example, related toemergency-room services for pregnant womenexperiencing complications. The Biden administration has argued in recent lawsuits that the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) ensures emergency abortion care. “The fact that President Trump is nominating a very well-educated conservative attorney who has made attacking abortion rights one of the cornerstones of his career is deeply troubling,” Holder told CNN, “He is an attorney who will go after not just the right to access to abortion but also, really, surveillance of people who could be seeking abortion care.” During Sauer’s time as Missouri solicitor general, a state health director reportedlygathered information on menstrual cyclesand pregnancies. The information emerged in a 2019 hearing over the state’s effort to deny Planned Parenthood a license to perform abortions. This year, according to Missouri Ethics Commission figures, Sauer contributed $777,000 to the Missouri Right to Life political action committee and two other groups opposed to a ballot measure, known as Amendment 3, to ensure abortion rights in the state. Among those ready to praise Sauer’s nomination was former US appellate judge Michael Luttig, who otherwise is an unrelenting critic of Trump and the Supreme Court’s decision to give him substantial immunity from prosecution. Related articleWilliam Hennessy, a veteran sketch artist who brought courtroom scenes to the nation, has died Sauer was as a law clerk to Luttig, who sat on the Richmond-based US based appellate court, before Sauer served in the chambers of Scalia, a conservative icon who died in 2016. “He is a man of great faith and great principle,” Luttig said of Sauer, “He has stayed close to his roots in all respects. He is devoted to his family.” Luttig has declared Trump v. United States a mistake akin to the 1857 Dred Scott decision that denied Black people citizenship. But he lays it at the feet of the justices, not Sauer. Yet it is precisely the case that has catapulted Sauer to one of the most powerful and prestigious legal positions in any administration. When Trump announced the solicitor general nomination on November 14, his statement referred to Sauer “winning a Historic Victory on Presidential Immunity, which was key to defeating the unconstitutional campaign of Lawfare against me and the entire MAGA Movement.” The SG, as the position is known colloquially, decides which of the government’s legal losses in lower courts to appeal and then defends the administration before the nine justices. Most visibly, the SG stands at a mahogany lectern, before the nine justices on their elevated bench. The men who have taken the role (and all but two SGs in history have been men) wear the traditional garb of grey morning coat and grey striped trousers. The post is currently held by Biden appointee Elizabeth Prelogar; the first woman SG was Elena Kagan, who served for a year before President Barack Obama appointed her to the Supreme Court in 2010. Sauer’s appointment breaks a pattern of SGs chosen from large corporate law firms or high-ranking academic positions. In his first presidential term, Trump chose Noel Francisco of the global Jones Day firm. Related articleSupreme Court says it will review if Catholic Charities is exempt from labor taxes in a major church-state case After his judicial clerkships, Sauer worked briefly for the small but influential conservative firm of Cooper Kirk, then spent five years as an assistant US attorney in the eastern district of Missouri. He then worked for small firms and eventually founded his own law group named after James Otis, a leading political and legal activist of the colonial era who developed foundational views of a limited government and individual property rights. Sauer was captivated in his childhood by the portrayal of Otis in the Revolutionary War classic work, “Johnny Tremain.” In private practice, Sauer wrote briefs backing abortion restrictions and arguing against the Obamacare contraceptive mandate. He represented 67 Catholic theologians and ethicists on the side of Hobby Lobby Stores, challenging the Affordable Care Act’s birth-control insurance regulation for employers. “The Mandate,” Sauer wrote in the 2014 case, “imposes a substantial burden on the religious freedom of Catholic employers and other religious believers who object on religious grounds to providing insurance coverage for abortifacients, elective sterilization, and/or contraceptives, and for education and counseling designed to encourage the use of such services. … (T)he Mandate thrusts Catholic and other religious employers into a ‘perfect storm’ of moral complicity in the forbidden actions.” The Supreme Courtsided with the challengers in a 5-4 decision. Sauer also represented members of Congress who opposed same-sex marriage, in a case that eventually led to the Supreme Court’s 2015 landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision creating a fundamental right to gay and lesbian unions. The following year, he wrote a brief for a group of conservative scholars in support of a restrictive Texas abortion law. The Supreme Court in June 2016 struck down the regulations as an undue burden on a woman’s right to end a pregnancy, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. From 2017 to 2023, Sauer served as the Missouri state solicitor, first taking the position at the urging of then attorney general (and now US senator) Josh Hawley. He joined with other Republican-run states in briefs to the high court against federal Covid vaccine mandates for certain health care workers and against abortion rights, including in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case that led to thereversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. During Sauer’s tenure as state solicitor general, he defended Missouri capital cases, including one that went all the way to the Supreme Court. That case, Bucklew v. Precythe, was brought by a convicted murderer challenging the state’s lethal injection protocol. The state won in a5-4 decision. The square-jawed Sauer keeps his dark hair closely cropped and wears small oval shaped wire-rimmed glasses. He exudes a buttoned-down restraint but can become animated on all manner of topics. “He’s a very well-read person with a ton of interests, from the sacred to the profane, almost literally,” said John Demers, who was a co-clerk in the Scalia chambers nearly 20 years ago and has stayed friends through the years. Demers, a vice president at Boeing, was an assistant attorney general for the National Security Division in the first Trump administration. “He’s a practicing Catholic and we share that piece in common,” Demers said. “He can talk about theology, and he can talk to you about ‘South Park.’” Sauer’s argument style can be similarly animated with moments of drama. When he appeared before a federal appellate court in 2023 for the state of Louisiana (after leaving the Missouri SG post) in a challenge to the Biden administration’s social media practices, he spoke rapidly and emphatically. At one point, his voice intensified with a personal claim that he had been censored after talking about the case in a recorded law office presentation: “The notion that Covid censorship is over is totally unsupportable. Two weeks ago, I gave a talk about this very case … criticizing federal government censorship.” He said the video had been posted on social media but then removed. “I was censored as a lawyer for the Louisiana attorney general,” he said, offering no further explanation nor being pressed on it by the judges hearing the case. When the social media case later went to the Supreme Court, the justices by a 6-3 voterejected that position, put forward by two states and five social-media users. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that the challengers had failed to demonstrate that they were injured by any administration actions. Sauer’s first name is Dean, but he has always gone by his middle name of John. He attended a Catholic grade school and then Saint Louis Priory, a Benedictine monk-run boys’ secondary school. He went to Duke on an academic scholarship and became captain of the varsity wrestling team. Before studying at Harvard Law School, he was a Rhodes scholar, attending Oriel College at the University of Oxford. Sauer’s family goes back several generations in Missouri. He and his wife have five young children. Associates say he is still deciding whether to move the family to Washington, DC. Sauer’s father, Fred, founded an investment firm and became president of Missouri Roundtable for Life, a cause to which John has contributed. (Fred Sauer ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor in 2012.) John Sauer also contributed heavily to the Missouri Right to Life PAC this year as the group was fighting the ballot measure to establish a right to abortion in the state’s constitution. Voters approved Amendment 3, which overturned a state ban and gave residents a right to end a pregnancy up to the point that a fetus would be viable, that is, live outside the woman. Since Sauer’s time as a state solicitor general, he has been active in numerous red state litigation efforts. After the 2020 presidential election, he joined with a handful of other Republican state lawyers to challenge the election results that gave Joe Biden the White House. He shepherded a brief on behalf of six states that sought to intervene in the case first filed by Texas against Pennsylvania and other swing states that favored Biden. (The Supreme Court declined to hear the case.) Sauer came to real national prominence at the end of 2023, when he represented Trump’s defense to charges brought by Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith, who had accused the former president of election fraud, conspiracy and other offenses that culminated in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. He was connected to Trump by Will Scharf, who was working in Missouri with Sauer and has since been designated by Trump to be White House staff secretary. Scharf recounted a call from Trump in August 2023 in aninterview with the Missouri Independent,“His legal team was looking to bring on a dedicated appellate team, and the president just called me and asked me if that was something that I was interested in.” Scharf said he, Sauer, and another lawyer “pitched the campaign the way you would pitch any client, and a couple days later, they hired us. And we’ve been working for the president ever since.” Sauer presented oral arguments before the DC Circuit and then Supreme Court on behalf of Trump. His ardent claims for presidential immunity extended famously in the lower court even to a situation when a president would order Seal Team Six to kill a political opponent. Before the justices in arguments last April, Sauer defended Trump on constitutional principles, as well as against the specific details of the election-subversion charges. Related articleExclusive: The inside story of John Roberts and Trump’s immunity win at the Supreme Court When confronted with the allegations that Trump helped create a “fraudulent slate” of presidential electors in the states, Sauer interjected: “so-called fraudulent electors.” He said referring to them as “fraudulent” amounted to “a complete mischaracterization.” “On the face of the indictment,” he told the justices, “it appears that there was no deceit about who had emerged from the relevant state conventions, and this was being done as an alternative basis.” He brushed aside any suggestion of wrongdoing by Trump in the states, despite that Smith’s indictment said Trump had “organized fraudulent slates of electors” to “obstruct the certification of the presidential election.” (State prosecutions related to 2020 fraudulent electors are ongoing.) Sauer told the justices Trump “absolutely” had a right to put forward alternate Republican electors. More broadly, Sauer asserted, “Without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, there can be no presidency as we know it.” It turned out the Supreme Court, where he could soon regularly appear as solicitor general,agreed.","Politics, Health"
More rural school districts are moving to a four-day week to attract and retain teachers,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/us/four-day-school-week-rural-districts/,"Tre Sisco wanted a teaching job with a good work-life balance after graduating from Missouri Southern State University in 2023. During his job hunt, he learned Missouri’s Independence School District was moving to a nontraditional, four-day school week — a change that would give staff and students Mondays off. The district is part of a growing trend in rural communities, where schools are switching to four-day school weeks to attract and retain high-quality teachers amid funding challenges and anationwide teacher shortage. Sisco, now a high school business class teacher and football coach in Independence, said the long weekend allows him time to prepare lesson plans for the week, go to the gym and care for his 10-month-old son. “It’s been amazing to have an extra day to relax,” Sisco said. “I spend time with family and get work done. It’s perfect.” Districts with four-day school weeks are more likely to be in states that mandate a certain number of instructional hours rather than instructional days, according toPaul Thompson, an associate professor at Oregon State University who studies the four-day concept. This gives districts the flexibility to extend the school day and shorten the week. Related articleDoubling up on classrooms, using online teachers and turning to support staff: How schools are dealing with the ongoing teacher shortage Students in these districts typically have longer school days, but the extended weekend is popular with them, as it is with most teachers and parents, according to experts and school officials. For parents who need childcare on that extra day, some school districts offer daycare centers. The growth is greater in some small rural communities, in part, because they receive less state funding and can’t afford to offer competitive salaries. Independence School District leaders said the shortened week has helped them compete with neighboring districts that have larger budgets and pay teachers higher salaries. Roughly 2,100 schools in 900 districts across 26 states have a four-day week, according to Thompson. Four-day school weeks have seen the most growth in the last decade in states west of the Mississippi River such as Colorado, Oregon, Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas, Arkansas and Montana, he said. Some cash-strapped districts are also shortening their week in hopes of cutting overall costs, Thompson said. The savings, however, have been minimal. Most school districts with four-day weeks saw only a 1-2% reduction in expenditures related to transportation and hourly staff, Thompson said. Dale Herl, Independence School District superintendent, said attracting and retaining the best teachers was one of the key reasons the district moved to a four-day week in 2023. Before the change, the district struggled to hire experienced teachers, particularly in math, science and industrial technology, Herl said. Now, teacher applications are up 360% since 2023, the majority of applicants being veteran teachers, Herl said. The extended weekend is a draw because it gives teachers more work-life balance, he said. “When I talk to teachers, they say the weekend feels like it’s their own again and they’re using those Mondays to prep and to grade for the upcoming week,” Herl said. The extra day off also allows students to catch up on homework, get tutoring, attend class makeups, hold club events, and take courses at community colleges, Herl said. The district also has sites that offer childcare on Mondays for parents in need. Andrew Fite, a high school senior in the Independence district, said he enjoys the extended weekend because it gives him more time to do homework, study with friends and spend time with family. He has also been able to pick up extra hours at part-time jobs. Fite said he sometimes uses Monday to meet with teachers, if they are in the school building, to go over class materials. “School can be pretty tiring, and I know a lot of people dread it and I think having a four-day week gives you a little bit of a reset and an extra day of your weekend,” Fite said. “On Monday, you have the freedom of what to do. So, if you want to just sit back and relax and prepare your mind for the week, you can do that.” Fite’s mother, Beckie Fite, said she fully supports the four-day week. Beckie Fite, who also has a daughter in ninth grade, said the weekends with her kids feel less rushed, allowing her to spend more quality time with them. She has also noticed her kids are performing better academically. “I love it, and I wish they would have done it when my kids were little,” Beckie Fite said. “The kids are less stressed, the families are less stressed, the teachers are less stressed. It’s hard to argue with that.” For the27J School District in Colorado, just outside of Denver, teacher recruitment was also a key factor in the switch to four-day weeks in 2018. Superintendent Will Pierce said his district of 24,025 students receives roughly 18% less state funding than some of the larger districts in the Denver area, making it harder to offer competitive salaries to teachers. So, school officials decided to shorten the week, a perk that has decreased teacher turnover from 26% in the 2018-2019 school year to 11% in the 2023-2024 school year. The school week runs Tuesday through Friday from about 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Pierce said. The district faced some challenges with the new schedule in the first couple of years, he said, and some parents and teachers left. One top concern for parents was Monday childcare, he said. However, six years on, the majority of school families have found solutions, and a small percentage use the district’s daycare on Monday, Pierce said. “Our parents … say they love having the longer weekend with their kids,” Pierce said. “And many of our staff still work on Monday, but they appreciate the mindless Saturday and Sunday, and then they can spend Monday gearing up for the week.” Jessica Lore, a single mother with three children ages 7, 13 and 15 in 27J schools, said she had mixed feelings about the four-day week. While the extended weekend gives her kids more time to relax and unwind, she believes they would better grasp the subjects and class lessons with an additional day in school. Lore, an accountant, said she also works full-time, so her teenagers have to watch the youngest child at home on Monday. The kids, she said, usually spend that day watching TV or playing with their toys. And she spends more money on groceries because the kids are home more, she said. “It’s kind of a double-edged sword,” Lore said. Research shows the four-day school week has had mixed results. A2021 study published by RAND, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, found that student achievement in schools with four-day weeks did not improve as quickly as in schools with traditional five-day weeks. The study also concluded that the rate of student absenteeism was about the same in four-day and five-day week schools. Additionally, elementary school students in districts with four-day weeks reported getting more sleep, but there was no difference for middle school and high school students. Van Schoales, a senior policy director at the Keystone Policy Center, which has alsostudied the four-day schedule,believes academic achievement in four-day week districts is lagging because the school days are longer and children have limited attention spans. Related articleTeachers are leaving, forcing this school to cancel classes. Lowering professional qualifications does not fix shortage, educators say “My guess is the quality of the instructional time and the quality of learning, it doesn’t get better,” Schoales said. “It’s not like you can say to kids … instead of eight hours a day go to school for 10 hours a day and they are going to be just as attentive, that’s just not going to happen.” The four-day model also hasn’t won the support of all teachers, Thompson said. He said some teachers have quit because they find that on the fifth day, they are still working just as much while meeting with students, teaching makeup classes and writing lesson plans. Thompson said only about 10% of school districts have reverted to a five-day week after school officials decided the four-day week wasn’t working. Among those districts is the Jasper Independent School District in Jasper, Texas, which returned to a traditional five-day week this year after having a four-day school week for two years. “In some places, it’s working toward the (district’s) goals and in other places, it’s not,” Thompson said. “That brings a question of, if not all districts are seeing these benefits, is this a desirable educational model and does it work for students?”",Society
Many Trump voters still have doubts about him. Can he hold them?,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/politics/trump-voter-doubts-analysis/,"Donald Trump’s margin of victory in the presidential election was provided largely by voters who retain significant doubts about his character, policy agenda or both. Results from the major surveys of voters’ choices on Election Day show that a substantial minority of people who voted for Trump worried that he is too extreme, lacks honesty or would steer the country toward authoritarianism. Trump also won many voters who disagree with some of his top policy priorities, including his pledge to execute the largest deportation ever of undocumented immigrants, according to boththe exit polls conducted by Edison Researchfor a consortium of media organizations that includes CNN andthe AP VoteCast surveyconducted by the NORC at the University of Chicago. For these conflicted Trump voters, both surveys show, those concerns were overshadowed by discontent over the outcomes of Joe Biden’s presidency and the belief that Trump would produce better results than Vice President Kamala Harris on the issues they cared most about: immigration, crime and, above all, inflation and the cost of living. The long-term implications of Trump’s 2024 victory may turn on whether his performance in office solidifies or severs his connection to those conflicted supporters. If voters conclude that Trump has delivered on his core campaign promises of securing the border, increasing public safety and providing more economic stability, strategists in both parties believe the GOP has the opportunity to cement the formidable gains he registered this year among several traditionally Democratic-leaning voter groups, including younger White men, Black men and Latino people overall. “If he has a record of success he can point to, the stage is set to continue to expand the Republican coalition,” said Jim McLaughlin, a lead pollster for Trump’s campaign. Trump clearly is entering the White House in a stronger position than after his first election in 2016. His popular vote win – the only time he has done so since he first entered politics – has given his 2024 victory more legitimacy andmost voters are expressing optimism he will improve their personal finances.And while Trump faced skepticism during his first term from the GOP leaders in the House (Paul Ryan) and Senate (Mitch McConnell), now the party’s leadership in both chambers shows little inclination to cross him. Meanwhile, on the Supreme Court, his three appointments have created a solid conservative majority that is more likely to back him than the closely divided court he inherited when he arrived in office. Business leaders who kept their distance the first time have trekked to Mar-a-Lago to signal their desire to work with him. And Trump’s gains among traditionally Democratic-leaning constituencies, especially non-White men, have left the party much more tentative about how to oppose him this time around. But once Trump takes office again, he faces the risk that at least some of his conflicted supporters will recoil as the elements of his personality and program that still concerned them on Election Day inevitably receive more attention. That risk will be greatly compounded for Trump if voters don’t see improvement on the issues they care most about – particularly their cost of living. “Nothing that Trump has talked about doing, whether it’s tariffs, tax cuts for wealthy people or the deportation plan, none of that is going to help people’s pocketbooks,” argued Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, chief strategy officer for Way to Win, a liberal group that focuses on electing progressive candidates of color. “And so that is an opening to hold him accountable on that, to educate people about that.” On a wide array of measures, the exit polls and AP VoteCast show that Trump won a crucial slice of voters who continued to express substantial unease about him and/or his agenda. In the exit polls, about 1 in 8 voters who described Trump as “too extreme” still voted for him. In the VoteCast survey, which phrased the question slightly differently, Trump won fully one-fifth of voters who said they were either very or somewhat concerned that his views were too extreme.  Likewise, in the VoteCast survey, Trump won 1 in 6 voters who expressed concern that he would steer the country in an authoritarian direction. Trump won almost exactly the same share of voters who said in the VoteCast survey that he lacks the moral character to serve as president. The same pattern held on key issues. In both the exit polls and VoteCast surveys, about 3 in 10 voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances voted for Trump. In both surveys, that was a slightlyhigherpercentage of pro-choice voters who supported Trump than in the 2020 election – before three of the justices he nominatedto the Supreme Court provided critical votes to overturn the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. In both surveys, Trump also won a vital segment of voters who opposed his plan for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. In the exit polls, Trump won just over 1 in 5 voters who said most undocumented immigrants should not be deported but rather given an opportunity to apply for legal status; VoteCast put his support among voters who opposed mass deportation at 1-in-4. Even among the voter groups most directly affected by these policies, Trump won substantial support from people who disagreed with him. In the exit polls, Trump won nearly one-fourth of Latinos who opposed mass deportation and slightly more than one-fourth of women who said that abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances. That was, again, an increase from 2020, when the exit polls found that Trump won only about one-fifth of women who supported legal abortion. On both issues, the AP VoteCast survey produced very similar results. All of this support was decisive in Trump’s victory. Whether in the exit polls or VoteCast, most voters said they worried Trump was too extreme, lacked the character to serve as president, or would steer the country in an authoritarian direction. Most in both surveys also opposed mass deportation and supported legal abortion. In the VoteCast survey, a clear majority of voters said they wanted the federal government to do more to expand access to health insurance and exactly half said they wanted government to do more to provide access to childhood vaccines – neither of which is likely under Trump. Without support from a substantial minority of the voters who held those negative or contrary views, Trump could not have won. Above all, the key to Trump’s success among these divided voters was their discontent over the economy, and their belief that Trump would improve their financial situation. Molly Murphy, a lead pollster for Harris, told me that she believed voters who thought Trump would improve conditions on the issue they cared most about – usually inflation, but also in some cases reinforced by immigration or crime – minimized any of these other personal or policy concerns about him. “If they thought that Trump was going to be better on their primary concern… They either forgave the other concerns or convinced themselves that” the elements of the Trump agenda they disliked “just won’t happen,” Murphy said. The major post-election surveys support that analysis.Exit polls results provided by the CNN polling unit show that Trump won one-third of the voters who said he was too extreme, but also said they were financially worse off than they were when he left office. (Among those who said their financial situation was even unchanged from four years ago, Trump only won 1 in every 11 voters who called him too extreme.) In the VoteCast survey, Trump similarly won 3 in 10 voters who said he lacked the moral character to serve as president, but who also described the economy as not so good or poor. (Less than 1 in 14 voters who believed Trump lacked moral character and were positive on the economy voted for him.) The economy’s critical role in offsetting doubts on other fronts about Trump is most apparent when looking at the role of abortion in the election. In 2022,as I wrote at the time, abortion did not overcome the Republican tilt of voters in red states such as Florida and Texas, but did prove a huge asset for Democrats in swing states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. But Harris didn’t win nearly as many pro-choice voters this time as Democratic gubernatorial and Senate candidates did then – or even, as noted above, as Biden did in 2020, long before the overturning of Roe v. Wade. McLaughlin, the Trump pollster, attributes that shift largely to the former president’s success at convincing voters he would not seek a national abortion ban and would leave the issue to the states. “Democrats kind of snuck up on the Republicans in ’22 with the abortion issue,” McLaughlin said. “And the Trump campaign made it a real emphasis to say we don’t support a national abortion ban. In most states, people were comfortable with the abortion laws, it had become a state’s right issues, and Donald Trump was not a threat to them on that issue.” But the election polls also made clear that many voters who supported abortion rights simply put more stress on the economy. Fully 36% of all voters said in the exit polls that they supported legal abortion in all or most circumstances, but also viewed the economy in negative terms. In many respects,as I’ve written, that was the collision of Harris’s greatest strength – the fear that Trump would rescind voters’ rights – against Trump’s – the belief that the Biden-Harris administration had mismanaged the economy. The exit polls found that Trump narrowly beat Harris among those pro-choice, economically-pessimistic voters, while the VoteCast survey gave Harris a tiny advantage among them. In either case, the result was that Trump won far too many voters who supported legal abortion for Harris to prevail. “On abortion specifically, I think those voters either concluded through his messaging or through their magical thinking that because he talks about the economy and the border most of the time, he probably doesn’t care about abortion,” Murphy said. That trade-off was especially brutal for Harris among White women without a college education. Those women are a huge voting bloc and always critical to the outcome in the three Rust Belt states that once again functioned as the tipping point of this election: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats had hoped Harris might improve over Biden’s 2020 performance with those blue-collar White women after the party’s gubernatorial candidates had all run relatively strongly with them in 2022, the first election following the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe. But Trump either matched or exceeded his 2020 margins among those women in all three states, both the exit polls and VoteCast found. A key reason: Trump routed Harris by about 2-to-1 among the White women without a college degree who supported legal abortion but were negative on the economy, according to figures provided by the CNN polling unit. Trump even won nearly half of college-educated White women, a much more Democratic-leaning bloc, who supported legal abortion but viewed the economy negatively, the exit polls found. Fernandez Anconasaid their group’s polling around the electionshowed that discontent over the economy and the border outweighed other doubts voters held about Trump – but did not erase them. “I do not read the data as showing a fundamental realignment among the traditionally Democratic coalition,” she argued. “It’s a very reluctant kind of support that they’re giving to Trump because they are tired of the status quo. Harris was primarily advocating for a return to the status quo. And they were saying, ‘I had to put my concerns about him aside because the economy has been so bad under Democrats.’” Murphy, though, said it is a mistake for Democrats to think of the conflicted Trump voters as “ambivalent” or choosing him only as the lesser of two evils in their minds. Despite their doubts about Trump, she said, they were affirmatively voting for him because they had become convinced he would provide more financial stability for their families. But, Murphy argues, holding those conflicted voters won’t be easy for Trump once he enters office and starts implementing the full sweep of his agenda. Once in office, she said, “I think his numbers crater for two reasons.” One, she said, “is because the things he will try to do are on their face unpopular.” The other risk he faces, she said, is that if Trump becomes entangled in political firefights over pardoning January 6, 2021, rioters, or ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, or allowing his appointees to undermine childhood vaccines, it will violate those voters’ expectations that he would prioritize their economic well-being. “The trade that many of these voters felt they were making was in some ways rooted in the idea that he wasn’t going to do [these things] or it wasn’t going to be a priority,” Murphy said. “When that’s what you are doing, you are telling voters about the economy not being a priority… and [that] gives Democrats a huge opportunity to lift up that he’s not someone you can trust to lead in your interests.” Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster, agreed that if Trump overreads his mandate, he could quickly strain his support among the voters ambivalent about him-including not only the racial minorities he drew into his coalition but white-collar Republicans who reluctantly backed him because they viewed Biden and Harris as too liberal. If Trump provides his most controversial nominees – such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and Kash Patel as director of the FBI – a “blank check” to pursue polarizing agendas, Ayres said, “we are going to be looking at Joe Biden level-job approval numbers before we turn around” for Trump. Trump, if he follows the constitutional limit on presidential terms, won’t appear on a ballot again himself. But his standing will affect the GOP’s position in the 2026 midterm elections and the race to succeed him in 2028 – just as Biden’s weakened position created an enormous,and likely insurmountable, headwind for Harris this year. Issues that were overshadowed by the economy in the 2024 election could still weaken Trump, and by extension other Republicans. Ayres, for instance, says Trump and the GOP will be hurt if Kennedy is confirmed and his anti-vaccination rhetoric contributes to future outbreaks of childhood diseases like measles. And any move by Trump’s administration to restrict access to abortion –for instance, by rolling back Biden’s moves to ease access to medication abortion– could alienate voters who believed him when he said he believed the issue should now be left to the states. Polls leave little doubt that most voters are dubious of widespread pardons for the January 6 rioters –something Trump has pledged to pursue within his first hours of a second term. But the dynamics of Trump’s victory last month illuminate that issues more central to voters’ daily lives remain most likely to function as the pivot point of the next four years. Both McLaughlin, the Trump pollster, and Murphy, the Harris pollster, point to the same straightforward central explanation for why voters returned him to the White House. “Voters didn’t like the direction of the country and they thought he could make their lives better,” McLaughlin said.  Echoed Murphy: “For voters, he was just the guy from the other party when they were unhappy.” If voters feel that their lives are improving over the next four years, the example of 2024 suggests they will suppress their other concerns about Trump and continue to support him, a trend that would benefit GOP candidates in 2026 and 2028. “He knows that if he is successful everything else will take care of itself,” said McLaughlin. “He knows his legacy is all contingent on having a strong economy.” But if Trump doesn’t reward the faith of these conflicted voters by making progress on the issues that most concern them, they may inexorably turn their focus back toward their other hesitations about him, a trend that would hurt GOP candidates in the coming elections.“Performance matters,” said Ayres. “Performance drives job approval and job approval drives votes. It’s not more complicated than that.”",Politics
Low-income Americans are struggling. It could get worse,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/economy/low-income-americans-inflation/,"Chiugo Akujuobi has survived on food pantries and donations from friends since fleeing their family home in Houston earlier this year. They said they grew tired of frequent transphobic comments from relatives. The 26-year-old now sleeps on a friend’s couch in North Texas. They graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Scripps College in 2021 and have struggled to find a full-time job, instead taking on some work doing graphic design, social media marketing and copywriting on a contract basis. Akujuobi is one of millions of Americans who are struggling in today’s economy. This calendar year, Akujuobi estimates they made less than $10,000. The poverty line was $15,480 for a single person in 2023, according to the latest data fromthe Census Bureau. The cost of living crisis in the US has eased somewhat, but low-income Americans are still struggling after years of high inflation and elevated interest rates. Their situation could worsen if President-elect Donald Trump keeps his promise of slapping hefty tariffs on America’s three biggest trading partners, which could reignite inflation, economists say. “I don’t know how I’ve survived for this long,” Akujuobi said. “If it gets worse, I know that poor people will still be resourceful. We just make do with what we have.” Inflation is down considerably from the 40-year highs of 2022, when gasoline pricestopped $5 a gallonand home pricessurged by double digits. However, prices were up a cumulative 22.2% in November of this year compared to January 2020, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, which tracks price changes of commonly purchased goods and services. And after jacking up interest rates to a23-year high, the Federal Reserve finally began to cut rates in September, though officials have said in recent speeches thatborrowing costsare still exerting pain on parts of the economy. Fed officials have also said they’re in no rush to lower borrowing costs. Many Americans are still in a tough spot: Nearly 30% of all US households this year said they spend more than 95% of their disposable income on necessities such as housing costs, groceries and utility bills,according to a Bank of America Institute report, up from 2019 levels. That share is higher, at around 35%, for households making less than $50,000 a year. “Lower-income households are always going to be the ones that feel the brunt of high inflation and high interest rates,” said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet. Wage growth finally began to outpace inflation in early 2023, with US households on the lowest end of the income spectrum seeing their wages grow the second-fastest, according toAtlanta Fed data. But their earnings have slowed sharply since then, trailing the wage growth of the richest Americans as of November. Companies that offer bargains and staple items, such as Ross Stores, Dollar General and Walmart, havereaped the rewardsfrom price-conscious consumers. Walmart posted higher-than-expected revenuefor the first three months of the year,and Dollar General had reported increased foot traffic. Retailers have also noted signs of low-income consumers feeling strained. “If you listen to earnings reports from some of the retailers who deal a lot with low- and moderate-income people, they uniformly say that people are under pressure,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at an event in New York earlier this month. If Trump proceeds with imposing25% tariffs on imported goods from Canada and Mexicoand an additional 10% duty on Chinese goods, prices could increase next year by 0.75%, according to an estimate by economists at the Yale Budget Lab provided to CNN. That would equal a loss of about $1,200 inannualpurchasing power per household, in 2023 dollars, according to the estimate. But prices could rise slightly less if Americans purchase goods that are produced domestically or from countries with lower tariffs. However, a high-inflation episode would likely look different fromthe most recent one that erupted in 2021, which was generally due to pandemic-fueled demand and supply shocks, economists say. This time, Americans won’t have support from savings they accumulated during the coronavirus pandemic and benefits from pandemic-era programs that have now expired, such as an extension to the child tax credit and free school lunches. “Households are not in as good a shape as they were coming immediately out of the pandemic, but we’re talking about a different inflation scenario,” said Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo. “You can think of tariffs as these as one-time price adjustments. Companies aren’t going to keep increasing their prices month after month because of new tariffs versus the supply and demand imbalances during the pandemic.” Still, low-income households would be heavily impacted in this scenario, Grein said. “Next year, we’ll likely have an environment where spending is positive, it’s slowing, but it’s masking a lot of these vulnerabilities that are coming to a head and impacting the lower-income segment dealing with inflation and rates to a much larger degree,” she said.","Society, Business"
Watch out for holiday package delays as Amazon’s strike continues,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/business/amazon-strike-shipping-delays/,"Last-minute holiday shoppers may want to give their digital carts a hard look, as Amazon workers remain on strike on the final weekend before Christmas. Amazon says customers can expect their packages to arrive on time,but logistics experts warn some shipments could face minor delays withthousands of workers on strikesince Thursday in California, Georgia, Illinois and New York. Most of Amazon’s customers won’t be affected because the company has a high number of facilities,said Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix, a software provider that tracks delivery data for package shippers. “They will have the ability to ship product from other locations. They won’t be shut down,” he said. “Some packages that might have taken one day to be delivered will now take two. Some that might have taken two days will take three. But it won’t be that many.” Amazon customers may notice that some items will have an “Arrives before Christmas” message posted to their order. Amazon said in October that it would hire 250,000 transportation and warehouse workers for the volume of shipping this season asholiday spendingwas expected to increase by as much as 3.5% from last year — a total of $989 billion. As of early December, though, only 10% of consumers reported they were completely done shopping, according to the National Retail Federation. Between the Saturday before Christmas and December 25, about 157.2 million shoppers wereexpected to complete holiday purchases, the National Retail Federation estimated. “Whether shoppers have planned out their shopping list or are waiting until the last minute, most shoppers still have purchases left to make before December 25,” said Phil Rist, executive vice president of strategy at Prosper Insights & Analytics, which conducted the National Retail Federation’s December holiday consumer survey. More than half of Americans are worried about deliveries being delayed this holiday season, according to a study in October byBadcredit.org. The shorter window between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year could play a role in last-minute shopping. With five fewer days than usual between the two holidays, the National Retail Federation estimated the Saturday before Christmas would have more buyers heading to stores and snagging deals onlinethan last year. More shoppers plan to finish their shopping online (49%) than department stores (37%), discount stores (27%), or clothing and accessory stores (25%), according to the National Retail Federation.

"Facebook inflicted ‘lifelong trauma’ on Kenyan content moderators, campaigners say",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/business/facebook-content-moderators-kenya-ptsd-intl/,"Campaigners have accusedFacebook parent Metaof inflicting “potentially lifelong trauma” on hundreds of content moderators in Kenya, after more than 140 were diagnosed with PTSD and other mental health conditions. The diagnoses were made by Dr. Ian Kanyanya, the head of mental health services at Kenyatta National hospital in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, and filed with the city’s employment and labor relations court on December 4. The medical reports were filed to the court by legal firm Nzili and Sumbi Associates as part of an ongoing lawsuit against Meta and Samasource Kenya – an outsourcing company that was contracted to review content for the tech giant. Content moderators help tech companiesweed out disturbing contenton their platforms and are routinely managed by third party firms, often in developing countries. For years, critics have voiced concerns about the impact this work can have on moderators’ mental well-being. Meta declined to comment on the medical reports due to the ongoing litigation, but said that it takes the support of moderators seriously and its contracts with third-party firms set out expectations about counselling, training and fair pay. The spokesperson added that moderators are able to customise the “content review tool,” so that, for example, graphic content appears blurred or in black and white. Samasource, now known as Sama, did not respond to a request for comment. Kanyanya said the moderators he assessed encountered “extremely graphic content on a daily basis which included videos of gruesome murders, self-harm, suicides, attempted suicides, sexual violence, explicit sexual content, child physical and sexual abuse, horrific violent actions just to name a few.” Of the 144 content moderators who volunteered to undergo psychological assessments – out of 185 involved in the legal claim – 81% were classed as suffering from “severe” PTSD, according to Kanyanya. The class action grew out of a previous suitlaunched in 2022by a former Facebook moderator, which alleged that the employee was unlawfully fired by Samasource Kenya after organizing protests against unfair working conditions, according to UK non-profit organization Foxglove, which is supporting the case. Last year, all 260 content moderators working at Samasource Kenya’s moderation hub in Nairobi were made redundant, “punished” for raising concerns about their pay and working conditions, Foxglove said. The moderators involved in the current legal claim worked for Samasource Kenya between 2019 and 2023, court documents show. In one medical record seen by CNN, a content moderator described waking up in cold sweats from frequent nightmares related to the graphic content they reviewed during the job. They added that this resulted in them experiencing frequent breakdowns, vivid flashbacks and paranoia. Related articleInstagram will force millions of teens into protected accounts Another former content moderator said she developed a “fear of seeing dotted patterns” – known as trypophobia – after seeing an image of maggots crawling out of a decomposing human hand. Martha Dark, co-executive director of Foxglove, said that “moderating Facebook is dangerous, even deadly, work that inflicts lifelong PTSD on almost everyone who moderates it.” “In Kenya, it traumatized 100% of hundreds of former moderators tested for PTSD… Facebook is responsible for the potentially lifelong trauma of hundreds of people, usually young people who have only just finished their education,” she said in a statement provided to CNN Friday. Dark believes that if these diagnoses were made in any other industry, the people responsible would be “forced to resign and face the legal consequences for mass violations of people’s rights.” This is not the first time that content moderators have taken legal action against social media giants after claiming the job traumatized them. In 2021, a content moderator for TikToksued the social media platformafter she says she developed psychological trauma as a result of her job. The following year, TikTok was hit withanother lawsuitfrom former content moderators.","Business, World"
‘A sort of superpower’: Unexpected revelations made possible by AI in 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-science-2024/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Charred to a crisp, the hundreds of brittle ancient scrolls would crumble if one were to attempt to unfurl them, and any trace of script would be nearly illegible. The Herculaneum scrolls, as they are known, still remain unopened, but thanks to the powerful tool that is artificial intelligence, their contents now lie within reach. Using AI and high-resolution X-rays, a trio of researchers decoded in 2023 more than 2,000 characters from the rolled scrolls — the remarkable feat laid barethe first full passagesfrom papyri that had survived the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The artifacts, recovered from a building believed to have been the house of Julius Caesar’s father-in-law, form an unprecedented cache of information about ancient Rome and Greece. Computer scientists who launched the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition designed to accelerate the deciphering process, hope that 90% of four scrolls will be unlocked by the end of 2024. The key challenge has been to virtually flatten the documents and distinguish the black ink from the carbonized papyri to make the Greek and Latin script readable. “The AI is helping us amplify the readability of the evidence of the ink,” said Brent Seales, a professor of computer science at the University of Kentucky who has been working to decode the scrolls for more than a decade. “The evidence for the ink is there. It’s buried and camouflaged in all of this complexity that the AI distills and condenses.” The project is one compelling example of the growing utility of artificial intelligence, which came of age in 2024 with the Nobel committee recognizing AI’s development and application in science for the first time: Thephysics prizerecognized John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their fundamental discoveries in machine learning, paving the way for how artificial intelligence is used today. A fuzzy and often overhyped term, AI aims to mimic human cognitive functions to solve problems and complete tasks. Artificial intelligence encompasses a range of computational techniques: using data sets to train and improve machine learning algorithms and enabling them to spot patterns and inform predictions. Some AI toolscan pose risks,such as systems used in hiring, policing and loan applications that replicate bias, because they may be trained on historical data reflecting prejudiced ideas, for example, on sex or race, that ultimately result in discrimination. AI has transformed the landscape of scientific discovery, with the number of peer-reviewed papers using AI tools increasing sharply since 2015 and those that use AI methodsmore likely to be among the most cited.More than half of1,600 scientists surveyed by Natureexpected AI tools to be “very important” or “essential” to the practice of research. However, the UK’s Royal Society, the world’s oldest academy of sciences, has warned that the black-box nature of many AI tools is limiting thereproducibility of AI-based research. For Seales, though, it’s a powerful instrument deployed wisely that has generated dramatic results. Related articleScientists say they can use AI to solve a key problem in the quest for near-limitless clean energy “AI is a field of computer science designed to try to solve problems in ways that we thought only humans could solve problems,” Seales said. “I think of the kind of AI we’re using as a sort of superpower making you able to see things in data that with human eyes you wouldn’t be able to see.” The Vesuvius Challenge is just one way the fast-moving field has shaken up science and revealed the unexpected in 2024. AI is also advancing scientists’ understanding of how animals communicate in the ocean depths, helping archaeologists find new sites in remote and inhospitable terrain, and solving some of biology’s greatest challenges. Researchers know the enigmatic clicks made by sperm whales vary in tempo, rhythm and length, but what the animals are saying with these sounds — produced through spermaceti organs in their bulbous heads — remains a mystery to human ears. Machine learning, however, has helped scientists analyze nearly 9,000 recorded click sequences, called codas, that represent the voices of approximately 60 sperm whales in the Caribbean Sea. The work may one day make it possible for humans to communicate with the marine animals. The scientists examined the timing and frequency of codas in solitary whale utterances, in choruses, and in call-and-response exchanges between the marine giants. When visualized with artificial intelligence, previously unseen coda patterns emerged in what the researchers described as akin to phonetics in human communication. In all, the program detected 18 types of rhythm (the sequence of intervals between clicks), five types of tempo (the duration of the entire coda), three types of rubato (variations in duration), and two types of ornamentation — an “extra click” added at the end of a coda in a group of shorter codas. These features could all be mixed and matched to form an “enormous repertoire” of phrases, thescientists reported in May. However, the approach has its limitations. While machine learning is adept at identifying patterns, it doesn’t shed light on the meaning. A next step, according to the study, is interactive experimentation with whales, along with observations of whale behavior, which could be an important part of unraveling the syntax of sperm whale click sequences. The approach could also be applied to vocalizations by other animals, Dr.Brenda McCowan, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, previously told CNN. She was not involved in the study. Meanwhile, on land, artificial intelligence is now turbocharging the search for mysterious lines and symbols etched into the dusty ground of Peru’s Nazca Desert that archaeologists have spent nearly a century uncovering and documenting. Often only visible from above, the sprawling pictograms depict geometric designs, humanlike figures and even an orca wielding a knife. A group of researchers led by Masato Sakai, a professor of archaeology at Japan’s Yamagata University, has trained an object detection AI model with high-resolution imagery of the 430 Nazca symbols mapped as of 2020. The team included researchers from IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. Between September 2022 and February 2023, the team tested the accuracy of its model in the Nazca Desert, surveying the promising locations by foot and with the use of drones The researchers ultimately “ground truthed” 303 figurative geoglyphs,almost doubling the known number of geoglyphsin a matter of months. The model was far from perfect. It suggested a staggering 47,000 potential sites from the desert region, which covers 629 square kilometers (243 square miles). A team of archaeologists screened and ranked those suggestions, identifying 1,309 candidate sites with “high potential.” For every 36 suggestions made by the AI model, the researchers identified “one promising candidate,” according to the study. Nevertheless, AI has the potential to make huge contributions to archaeology, particularly in remote andharsh terrains such as deserts, even though the models are not yet entirely accurate, said Amina Jambajantsan, a researcher and data scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology’s department of archaeology in Jena, Germany. Jambajantsan wasn’t involved in the Nazca research but uses an AI model to identify burial mounds in Mongolia based on satellite imagery. “The problem is archaeologists don’t know how to build a machine learning model and data scientists, typically, are not really interested in archaeology because they can get much more money elsewhere,” Jambajantsan added. AI models are also helping researchers understand life at the smallest scale: strings of molecules that form proteins, the building blocks of life. While proteins are built from only around 20 amino acids, these can be combined in almost endless ways, folding themselves into highly complex patterns in three-dimensional space. The substances help form hair, skin and tissue cells; they read, copy and repair DNA; and they help carry oxygen in the blood. Related articleThis startup is using AI to ‘supercharge’ crop breeding. It could help protect farmers from the climate crisis For decades, decoding these 3D structures has been a challenging and time-consuming endeavor involving the use of fussy lab experiments and a technique known as X-ray crystallography. However, in 2018 a game-changing AI-based tool arrived on the scene. The latest iteration of the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, developed by Demis Hassabis and John Jumper at Google DeepMind in London, predicts the structure of almost all 200 million known proteins from amino acid sequences. Trained on all the known amino acid sequences and experimentally determined protein structures, the database acts as a “Google search.” It provides access at the touch of a button to predicted models of proteins, accelerating progress in fundamental biology and other related fields, including medicine. The tool has been used by at least 2 million researchers around the world. “It’s really a stand-alone breakthrough solving a traditional holy grail in physical chemistry,” Anna Wedell, a professor of medical genetics at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, told CNN after Hassabis and Jumper were among the three winners of the 2024Nobel Prize for chemistry. Related articleHow AI could power the climate breakthrough the world needs The tool does have some limits. Attempts to apply AlphaFold to proteins based on mutated sequences, including one linked to early breast cancer, have confirmed that the software is not equipped to predict the consequences of new mutations in proteins. AlphaFold is only the most high-profile of a number of AI tools being deployed in biomedical fields. Machine learning is accelerating efforts to compile anatlas of every single type of cell in the human bodyand discovering molecules that become new drugs, including a type of antibiotic that may work againsta particularly menacing drug-resistant bacteria.

"‘Stranger Things 5’ has wrapped. Judging from the cast and crew tributes, we are so not ready",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/20/entertainment/stranger-things-5-wrapped-tributes/,"It’s hard to believe that it’s been over eight years since viewers were first introduced to the mysterious and intriguingly retro show “Stranger Things,” and even harder to believe that it’s soon all coming to an end. Some of the cast and crew of the megahit Netflix series announced on Friday that this week marked the wrap on production of Season 5 of the show, set to debut sometime next year. Noah Schnapp, who plays Will Byers on “Stranger Things” and was the first to experience the nefarious “Upside Down” in Hawkins, Indiana back in Season 1, wrote atribute on Instagram. “As I close this chapter of my life, I can’t help but be forever grateful for the incredible people that I’ve met and valuable life/career lessons I learned through this decade journey,” Schnapp wrote, going on to list his “top 10” alongside a carousel of nostalgic photos from the early days of the series. Among Schnapp’s list were nods to “Stranger Things” creators the Duffer Brothers, who he said taught him “the creative process takes time and it’s okay to be meticulous about creating perfect moments.” On his own Instagram, co-creator Ross Dufferwrote abouthow they’ve “been telling this story for nearly a decade now. Many of our cast members joined us when they were kids, just ten or eleven years old. It wasn’t just a show for them—it was a defining part of their childhood. They’ve grown up before our eyes, becoming more than actors—they’ve become family.” Another cast member to mark themoment on social mediawas Finn Wolfhard, who plays Will’s best friend Mike Wheeler on the show. Sharing a photo of himself with his castmates as youngsters from the first season, Wolfhard wrote that he’s “still in shock” about his work on the final season coming to an end. “We shot it for a year and I’ll miss all of my friends and our characters terribly. When I think of the show, I picture this first photo. A bunch of goofy young people making something they think is cool but really have no clue what’s to come,” Wolfhard wrote. “I feel like we’re still those people and I’m lucky to still stand beside them today. I hope you’ll love this season as much as I do. See you all next year.” Schnapp ended his tribute with a heartfelt note of gratitude, writing, “‘Stranger Things’ was more than a job; it was a lifelong dream. A dream made reality thanks to the Duffers. Thank you for taking a chance on me when I was just a 10 year old kid and entrusting me with something so important to you both. Together, this cast + crew has built something so very special, and I couldn’t be any more excited for the world to see the final chapter. Stranger Things is a never ending story for me - it’s in my heart forever.” “Stranger Things” is a dark sci-fi/horror series that follows a group of teenagers and their families as they face off against an unnamed evil lurking in a mirror dimension – known as the “Upside Down” – underneath their small town. Beginning in 2016, the show has run for four seasons and costars Winona Ryder, David Harbour and Millie Bobby Brown. Along the way, the series welcomed some brilliant additional cast members who all became breakout stars, including Sadie Sink, Priah Ferguson, Joseph Quinn and Maya Hawke. The show has won 12 Primetime Emmys thus far, and introduced us to the terrifying Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) in 2022’s Season 4. Netflix has not yet announced a specific date for the premiere of Season 5, other than noting it will be sometime next year.",Entertainment
"Adam Sandler is still having ‘funukah’ with his ‘Chanukah Song’ 30 years later, and so is my family",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/entertainment/adam-sandler-chanukah-song-turns-30/,"Ahead of “Saturday Night Live’s” holiday episode, a performance on the show by Adam Sandler 30 years ago is still bringing the “funukah.” Co-written by “SNL” writers Ian Maxtone-Graham and Lew Morton, Sandler first debuted “The Chanukah Song” during a Weekend Update segment on December 3, 1994, expressing his perplexity about why there were so few songs about the Jewish festival of light. Over the years, the comical tune became part of the holiday season cannon. It has been updated in four different versions with varying lyrics and cultural references, but the tune has stood the test of time. When Sandler’s animated Chanukah movie “Eight Crazy Nights” hit theaters in 2002, “The Chanukah Song” Part 3 released with the film. That version of the song featured a choir of children, named by Sandler as “The Drei-Dreis” (after the Chanukah toy known as a “dreidel”), singing background vocals. Three of those singers, as it turned out, were my cousins – who auditioned and were cast to be part of “The Drei-Dreis.” “We performed live at a concert with Adam when he debuted it live. Rob Schneider sang with us! And then we recorded for the ‘Eight Crazy Nights’ album at a music studio in Hollywood,” my cousin, Jono Wagmeister, now 34, recalled of his audition alongside his brothers David, 37, and Michael, 29. (At the time, they were 11, 14 and 7 years old, respectively.) My cousins told me that Sandler’s team had traveled to Jewish synagogues around Los Angeles to audition children who sang in synagogue choirs. For my cousins, who sang with the youth singing group at University Synagogue in Los Angeles, it was a kids’ dream come true to be selected. “It was really fun to sing with Adam and other Jewish singers from around LA,” my cousin David shared. “When we met Adam backstage, he was such a genuinely nice and down-to-earth guy. Also, the fact that it was important to Adam that his backup singers be Hebrew school kids made me feel even more proud to be Jewish. It was all around a great experience!” My cousin Michael, who is the baby of our family, was actually too young to audition. But Sandler’s team let him have a role anyway. “I was super jealous that my brothers were doing it and wanted to force myself in somehow, so I went when they auditioned after little league practice in a Yankees jersey and cleats. Adam’s team thought I looked cute and asked if I sang, too,” Michael recalled. “They included me as the youngest member on one condition – that I wear exactly that outfit at the performance with Adam. He even called it out specifically and poked fun at my cleats during the concert!” These “Chanukah Song” memories have not just lasted decades within the Wagmeister family – but also for Sandler and people around the world who love the tune. “If it comes on the radio, and I hear it, I get excited. That’s still awesome,”Sandlertold the New York Post last year. In celebration of three decades of Sandler singing about “eight crazy nights,” Here’s a look back at the lyrics to the “not too shabby” and very “happy, happy, happy, happy” “Chanukah Song.” “The Chanukah Song” Put on your yarmulkeHere comes ChanukahSo much funukkahTo celebrate ChanukahChanukah is the festival of lightsInstead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas treeHere’s a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me David Lee Roth lights the menorahSo do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ahGuess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli?Bowzer from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzarelli Paul Newman’s half Jewish, Goldie Hawn’s half, tooPut them together, what a fine lookin’ Jew You don’t need “Deck The Halls” or “Jingle Bell Rock”‘Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock, both Jewish Put on your yarmulkeIt’s time for ChanukahThe owner of the Seattle Supersonic-ahsCelebrates Chanukah O.J.

"If you spend Christmas at the movies, you’re not alone",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/entertainment/christmas-movie-theaters-tradition-cec/,"Some American holidays are intrinsically tied to certain traditions. Fourth of July and fireworks shows. Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping. And then there’s Christmas and the movie theater. Moviegoing may not be the first thing you think of when considering the Christmas season. There are the trees, sure, then the carols, even the cut-out cookies. Butgoing to the movie theatereither on Christmas, or in the days surrounding it, has become a cherished holiday tradition for many families. “On that day, it’s like the movie theater becomes a midnight mass,” said Matthew Germenis, 33, who’s been going to the movies on Christmas since he was a teen. “It’s just something really, really special.” Germenis isn’t alone. The holiday season has become a massive time for movie theaters and studios. In years past, film franchises like “Harry Potter” and “The Lord of the Rings” became holiday classics thanks purely to holiday release dates —in 2001, the first Harry Potter film, released just before Thanksgiving, topped the holiday season box office, while “The Fellowship of the Ring” came in at No. 3. The former went on to become the highest grossing movie of the entire year. In other words: The holiday season, especially the week between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day, pulls thousands of people to cinemas, many in the name of tradition. But exactly how the holiday and moviegoing became so intertwined is, well, a bit of a Christmas miracle. Christmas Day, and really the week entirely, is especially suited for going to the movies, said Alicia Kozma, director of the cinema department at Indiana University. Kids aren’t in school and need a place to go; most people have free time, and maybe they’re tired of family; and there’s always a fresh crop of new movies that have been building buzz for months. It helps that movie theaters are one of the only places reliably open on Christmas — creating appeal both for those celebrating the holiday and others just trying to find something to do. “It’s this perfect storm of variables,” Kozma said. This wasn’t always the case. Christmas used to be seen as a sacred day, reserved for family and staying at home, Kozma said. But in the late 1940s and 1950s, as TV sets became more commonplace, studios were searching for reasons to get people back into movie theaters. So one studio, Paramount Pictures, took a gamble. In 1947, it released “Road to Rio,” starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope as two stowaways on a ship headed to Rio de Janeiro. What made the movie significant was its release date: Christmas Day. In an unexpected twist, the movie became a huge hit, Kozma said. Despite the holiday, audiences flocked to the theaters, thus beginning the association between Christmas and the movies. Today, the movies we see in theaters on Christmas aren’t necessarily holiday-themed. Those types of  movies tend to be released earlier in the season or forego the theater altogether — this year, “Red One” came out in theaters in November, as did streaming offerings “Nutcrackers” (Hulu) and “Hot Frosty” (Netflix). Instead, the period immediately around Christmas is used to launch films with broad appeal, Kozma said, or to start building excitement for certain movies ahead of the Academy Awards in March. Take“A Complete Unknown,” the Bob Dylan biopic starring Timothée Chalamet. Having the film available at Christmas, when more people in general will be trying to see a movie, helps build audience buzz early. That buzz, studios hope, will last for the entire theatrical run, all the way into February or even March, Kozma said. “Christmas releases tell you that a studio or distributor somewhere thinks that these films have awards potential,” Kozma said. Will Chalamet get an Oscar nod for his turn as Dylan? We don’t know yet, but a Christmastime release date at least keeps him top of mind. And the perks of that release window doesn’t just apply to awards fare. Even smaller, lesser-known films benefit from opening around Christmas, Kozma said, thanks to increased visibility in a busy moviegoing season. On the other hand, launching big-budget film franchises during the holidays helps build a tradition that studios can bank on in the future. The films in “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, for example, were all released in the week leading up to Christmas, meaning families could watch the adventures of Frodo, Gandalf and the rest of the fellowship during the holiday for three years straight. That fourth year, even without Hobbits on the big screen, families might have still gone to the theater anyway. “You just start to get into the habit of doing something,” Kozma said. “And then you just replace the film once the series is over with whatever else is coming out.” Germenis, who’s been going to the movies on Christmas since he was a teen, recognizes that most of the movies that come out on Christmas tend to be packed with A-list stars or are simply “things we really want to see.” Having a tradition of going to the movies around Christmas is kind of “thrust upon you,” he said. Andrew Mohrman, 20, doesn’t exactly remember when his family’s Christmas tradition of heading to the movie theater began. But for as long as he can remember, his family would wake up bright and early, open presents and then head to the local theater for the earliest showtime. Now, he looks forward to it every year, and will start planning what movie to see as soon as Christmas release dates are announced. This year, his family is planning on seeing “A Complete Unknown.” On Christmas, the theater “definitely feels warmer,” Mohrman said. “Everyone’s a little more friendly and festive, even if they’re not celebrating Christmas.” And the theater is always packed, Germenis said. While his yearly tradition tends to be a solo one, Germenis said going to the movies never truly feels lonely. Even the people on the screen become a part of his memories of the holidays. “Over the past 15 or 16 years, at least, I’ve spent as many Christmases with (Leonard DiCaprio) as I have with my family,” he said. Those holidays then become intrinsically tied to the year’s movie. He still recalls seeing “The Shape of Water” in 2017, one of the times his parents joined him; or “The Wolf of Wall Street” in 2013, seated next to two elderly women that stuck out the entire movie, despite the lascivious opening scenes that sent others in the theater home after just a few minutes. The Christmases don’t blend together, he said, they always feel distinct. Even with the popularity of the theater on Christmas — the blockbuster movies, the big-name actors, even just the tradition — there are still some who may balk at the idea of spending the holiday away from home. But to Germenis, the entire experience is about community: You and a room full of strangers all decided to see the same movie at the same time, on this day of all days. “That’s the Christmas spirit right there. This is the thing that brings us all together,” he said. “What better reason?” Warner Bros. Pictures and CNN are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.","Entertainment, Society"

Scientists think they know why Stonehenge was rebuilt thousands of years ago,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/science/stonehenge-monument-early-farmers/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Scientists made a major discovery this year linked to Stonehenge — one of humanity’s biggest mysteries — and the revelations keep coming. A team of researchers shared evidence in August suggesting that the Altar Stone, an iconic monolith at the heart of Stonehenge, wastransported hundreds of miles to the sitein southern England nearly 5,000 years ago from what’s now northeastern Scotland. Just a month later, a report led by the same expertsruled out the possibility that the stone came from Orkney, an archipelago off Scotland’s northeastern coast that’s home to Neolithic sites from that time frame, and the search for the monolith’s point of origin continues. Now, research building on the two previous studies suggests that Stonehenge may have been reconstructed in England around 2620 to 2480 BC to help unify ancient Britons as newcomers arrived from Europe. The new study, published Thursday in the journalArchaeology International, also reveals how Neolithic people may have moved the 13,227-pound (6-metric-ton) block over 435 miles (700 kilometers) from where it originated. Similarities between stone circles in Scotland and Stonehenge, located in Wiltshire on the southern edge of England’s Salisbury Plain, add to a growing collection of clues showing there was likely more connectivity between ancient societies in these two distant areas than once thought, according to the study. Related articleGrisly remains point to a bleak, ancient chapter in British history Together, the findings from the new study and those published earlier this year are shedding light on the purpose of Stonehenge and the arrangement of its monoliths, an enduring enigma since excavations began at the site in the 17th century. “These new insights have significantly expanded our understanding as to what the original purpose of Stonehenge might have been,” said lead study author Mike Parker Pearson, professor of British later prehistory at the University College London’s Institute of Archaeology, in an email. “It shows that this site on Sailsbury Plain was important to the people not just living nearby, but across Britain, so much so that they brought massive monoliths across sometimes hundreds of miles to this one location.” Construction on Stonehenge began as early as 3000 BC and occurred over several phases in an area first inhabited as early as 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, according to the researchers. Previous analysis has shown that bluestones, a type of fine-grained sandstone, and larger silicified sandstone blocks called sarsens were used in the monument’s construction. The bluestones were brought from 140 miles (225 kilometers) away at the Preseli Hills area in west Wales and are thought to have been the first stones placed at the site. The sarsens, used later, came from the West Woods near Marlborough, located about 15 miles (25 kilometers) away. Researchers believe the Altar Stone was placed within the central horseshoe during a rebuilding phase. While the exact date is unknown, the study authors believe the stone arrived between 2500 and 2020 BC. It’s during that rebuilding phase, according to the research, that Stonehenge’s builders erected the large sarsen stones to form an outer circle and an inner horseshoe made of trilithons, or paired upright stones connected by horizontal stone beams, which remain part of the monument to this day. The Altar Stone is the largest of the bluestones used to build Stonehenge. Today, the Altar Stone lies recumbent at the foot of the largest trilithon and is barely visible peeking through the grass. Many questions remain about the exact purpose for Stonehenge and the Altar Stone. But the monument aligns with the sun during the winter and summer solstices. “There’s good evidence to suggest that these large stone monoliths have ancestral significance, representing and even embodying the ancestors of the people who placed them,” Parker Pearson said. “(The Altar Stone’s) location within Stonehenge is important as if you stand at the center of the stone circle, the midwinter solstice sun sets over its middle.” During the winter, Neolithic people would gather near Stonehenge at the village of Durrington Walls, bringing pigs and cattle with them for a feast, Parker Pearson said. Stonehenge was also the largest burial ground of its time, lending support to the idea that the site may have been used as a religious temple, a solar calendar and an ancient observatory all in one. And nearly half the Neolithic people buried near Stonehenge came from somewhere other than Salisbury Plain. The new research adds a political twist to the backstory of a rebuilt Stonehenge. “The fact that all of its stones originated from distant regions, making it unique among over 900 stone circles in Britain, suggests that the stone circle may have had a political as well as a religious purpose — as a monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos,” Parker Pearson said. This show of unity — transporting giant stones long distances — would not have been easy for Neolithic people. The study authors don’t think boats at the time would have been strong enough to carry anything like the Altar Stone across coastal waters. “Though the wheel had been invented elsewhere, it hadn’t quite reached Britain yet, so the massive stone blocks would likely have had to be dragged by wooden sledge sliding atop wooden rails that could be continuously lifted and re-laid,” Parker Pearson said. The wooden sledge could have had shock absorbers made from vegetation to cushion the stone, which would have been susceptible to cracking on the long journey, the study authors said. Related articleNeolithic engineers built megalithic monument with stones that weighed as much as two jumbo jets Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of people would have been needed to help move the stone over land, and the journey may have taken about eight months, the researchers noted in the paper. “Travel by land would have provided much better opportunities for spectacle, pageantry, feasting and celebration that would have drawn people in (the) thousands to witness and take part in this extraordinary venture,” according to the study. Moving the massive stone from Scotland to southern England suggests there was a network between two distant groups fostered by collaboration and cooperation — something the researchers think existed due to striking cultural similarities in both locations. “They would have taken significant coordination across Britain — people were literally pulling together — in a time before telephones and email to organize such an effort,” Parker Pearson said. The Altar Stone is similar in both size and placement to other large horizontal blocks in stone circles found in northeast Scotland, the study authors said. These recumbent stone circles have only been found in that part of Scotland, rather than the rest of England, which suggests that the Altar Stone may have been a gift from the community in northern Scotland to signify a type of alliance. “Moreover, if you look at the layouts of some of the houses at Durrington Walls near Stonehenge, there’s a striking similarity in their architecture to those found far north in the Orkney Islands, but rarely anywhere in between,” Parker Pearson said. “We’ve also known for some time that people shared a style of pottery — which we callGrooved Ware— across the entire island of Britain. It seems to have been one of several innovations that were developed in Scotland and spread south from 3000 BC onwards.” As an island, Britain’s population has changed multiple times. The region’s early farmers descended from people from the Middle East who arrived on the island about 6,000 years ago, bringing agricultural practices with them. The newcomers replaced hunter-gatherer communities that had inhabited Britain previously and formed the majority of the population from 4000 to 2500 BC, Parker Pearson said. But around 2500 BC, people began to arrive in Britain from Europe, largely from what’s now known as Germany and the Netherlands, and it’s around this time when Stonehenge was rebuilt, according to the study. The researchers believe that the rebuilding process was “a response to a legitimation crisis brought on by this influx of new people” and an attempt to unite the Neolithic farmer population. Related articleRare lunar event may reveal Stonehenge’s link with the moon The European arrivals, called theBeaker people for the distinctive potterythat they buried with their dead, brought technology such as the wheel and metalworking with them. “Within 16 generations over 400 years it seems that most people had ancestries that were a mix of the two, yet this was a mix of 90% incomer to 10% indigenous farmer,” Parker Pearson said. “The genetic makeup of Britain’s population almost completely changed over half a millennium.” Eventually, the Beaker people’s descendants replaced Neolithic farmers and became Britain’s dominant population. So ultimately, Stonehenge, which brought “together these extraordinary and alien rocks which (symbolized) and embodied far and distant communities within a complex material and monumental expression of unity between people, land, ancestors and the heavens,” failed to unify the same communities which built it, the study authors noted. “The findings of this study shed most unexpected and highly impressive new light on the history of Stonehenge – a remarkable achievement considering how well-studied this famous site has been,” said Duncan Garrow, a professor in the department of archaeology at the University of Reading specializing in European prehistory. Garrow was not involved in the new study. Now, the researchers are redoubling their efforts to determine where exactly in northeast Scotland the Altar Stone originated, said Richard Bevins, coauthor of the new study, as well as the previous studies this year concerning the Altar Stone. Bevins is an honorary professor in the department of geography and Earth sciences at the UK’s Aberystwyth University. “It’s really gratifying that our geological investigations can contribute to the archaeological research and the unfolding story as our knowledge has been improving so dramatically in just the last few years,” Bevins said. “Our research is like forensic science. We are a small team of (Earth) scientists, each bringing their own area of expertise; it is this combination of skills that has allowed us to identify the sources of the bluestones, and now the Altar Stone.”",Science
California squirrels are eating another rodent for the first time,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/science/california-squirrels-carnivorous-eating-voles/,"Warning: This story contains graphic images that may upset some readers. Traditionally known for stuffing their cheeks with nuts, squirrels can be carnivorous — though recorded instances of the rodents hunting and killing other live vertebrates are rare, with few species known to have done so. Now, scientists have found unprecedented evidence of another type of squirrel exhibiting carnivorous behaviors, including hunting, killing and eating voles, according to a new study. The research, published Wednesday in theJournal of Ethology, is part of the Long-Term Behavioral Ecology of California Ground Squirrels Project at Briones Regional Park in Contra Costa County. The project examines how California ground squirrels — native to the state’s grasslands — adapt their behavior in response to environmental changes, in this case an increase in the local vole population. Related articleAn owl’s ‘shocking’ color should hinder hunting. Scientists may have figured out why it works In parts of Northern California, vole infestations have been observed. At the research site, the study’s authors noted a significantly higher number of voles than average over the past decade. California ground squirrels have typically been considered herbivores or granivores, eating mostly plants and seeds. The new findings offer the first documentation of the species actively preying on other live vertebrates — underscoring its ability to respond to changes in the ecosystem. “This research radically changes our perception of squirrels, one of the most familiar mammals in the world,” said lead study author Jennifer Smith, associate professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, via email. “In the face of human insults such as climate change and drought, these animals are resilient and have the potential to adapt to live in a changing world.” Squirrels are an important part of California ecosystems, and understanding whether food discovery is a socially transmitted trait in these populations could provide key insights into how other species will adjust to shifting environments, Smith said. Smith and her colleagues observed the squirrels’ meat-eating behavior during a study period from June 10 to July 30. During that time, the scientists used live traps to capture, mark and release California ground squirrels on a biweekly basis. The study team collected detailed data on each squirrel, including its sex, reproductive status and body mass, labeling every animal with two identification tags and a unique fur mark using dye to ensure all the squirrels studied could be tracked throughout the observation period. Squirrels are particularly useful for studying animal resilience to environmental changes because they are active during the day and easy to trap, mark and observe, Smith said. The researchers split the squirrels into three groups and observed the animals’ behavior on non-trapping days. The team recorded 74 interactions between the squirrels and voles, and 42% of the encounters involved squirrels — including both male and female juveniles and adults —actively hunting and consuming the voles. “We already knew that (California ground squirrels) could live (in) a range of elevations and feed (on) a breadth of plants but what is most striking and incredible is the speed at which they shifted their behavior to this local surge in vole abundance,” Smith said. The study revealed other previously undocumented social dynamics between squirrels and voles as well. Some interactions between the animals were positive, including foraging, greeting and playing. Other behaviors were competitive, characterized by chasing, physical pushing, pouncing and biting. “Voles (have come to) recognize the squirrels as predators,” said John Koprowski, dean of the Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Wyoming, who was not involved in the study. “There’s likely some really neat interplay between the two species because being eaten is usually not a great way to continue passing on your genes.” The study’s findings suggest squirrels might be best classified as opportunistic omnivores based on their willingness to hunt and consume live prey, particularly when there is an abundant supply. Protein is a limited yet necessary resource for squirrels to thrive, and hunting voles likely provides them with a faster, more accessible nutrition boost than seeds, Koprowski explained. “It’s a wonderful way for them to capitalize on a very abundant resource … to provide enough sustenance for many (squirrels) to use,” he said. Though humans typically categorize animals by their eating habits, it’s not uncommon for even the strictest carnivore to eat fruit every once in a while, Koprowski added. This phenomenon in which an animal capitalizes on a necessary resource when it’s made available to them is known as dietary plasticity, according to Koprowski. If an animal doesn’t adapt to utilize the resource, it’s likely another species will take advantage of it. Related articleWolves may be pollinators as well as predators, study suggests While this discovery may initially seem concerning to some, Koprowski said such a change in diet is quite normal for animals. Voles frequently experience surges in population growth and are considered pests, so having new predators such as California ground squirrels will help keep vole numbers under control, he said. The new findings may also help set the stage for future research on the adaptability of different squirrel species and other mammals in the face of environmental changes, according to Smith. “Animals can either adapt or go extinct in a human-impacted world,” Smith said. “These animals are showing … us the incredible resilience of some species and by studying these processes we can offer meaningful insights for conservation.” Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.",Science
Fossil discovery of newly identified saber-toothed predator is the oldest of its kind,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/science/gorgonopsian-fossil-mallorca-saber-tooth/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Beforedinosaurs walked the Earthand tens of millions of years before the first mammals appeared, distant mammal relatives with long, serrated canine teeth were the dominant carnivores on land. Called gorgonopsians, the earliest animals in this lineage have long been missing from the fossil record. But the discovery of a newly identified gorgonopsian — the oldest saber-toothed animal ever found — is filling a longstanding blank space in the group’s history. These slender predators are known mostly from bones that are less than 270 million years old, but the recent fossil find is thought to be an unprecedented 280 million to 270 million years old. Related articleBaby saber-toothed cat mummy found in Siberia with intact skin, fur and toes is ‘mind-blowing,’ scientists say The newfound gorgonopsian adds to one of the earliest branches of the therapsid family tree — theTherapsida orderincludes not only gorgonopsians but also the ancestors of modern mammals and other nonmammalian groups that are now extinct. The finding is a notable puzzle piece that could help shed light on the earliest forebears of mammals, experts said. Gorgonopsians vanished around 252 million years ago, and their lineage died with them. All gorgonopsians had daggerlike canine teeth, and species ranged widely in size. Some were as small as cats, while others were as big as polar bears. Fossils of the newly described gorgonopsian included its knifelike canines; parts of its jaw; some vertebrae, ribs, tailbones and toe bones; and most of the bones from a hind limb, researchers reported Tuesday in the journalNature Communications. The specimen’s blunt-snouted skull was incomplete but is estimated to measure about 7 inches (18 centimeters) long, and the animal would have been as tall as a medium-size dog and weighed roughly 66 to 88 pounds (30 to 40 kilograms), according to study coauthorKen Angielczyk, MacArthur Curator of Paleomammalogy at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History. Other than being four-legged and having a long tail, the gorgonopsian wouldn’t have looked very doglike, Angielczyk said. Similar to reptiles, gorgonopsians didn’t have fur or visible ears, he said. But although the animal physically resembled lizards in some ways, please don’t call it a “lizard-dog,” he told CNN. “Lizards are a kind of reptile, and nonmammalian therapsids like gorgonopsians are part of a completely different evolutionary lineage, part of the lineage that includes mammals,” Angielczyk said. “While mammals and reptiles share a common ancestor that lived about 320 million years ago, they are separate lines of descent.” Related articleFossilized poop reveals secrets of how dinosaurs came to dominate Earth Gorgonopsians do share some traits with their mammal cousins. One of those is having teeth of different shapes and sizes, “with those teeth providing different roles in the feeding system,” Angielczyk said. “That’s something that’s very common in mammals today.” Unlike mammals, gorgonopsians seemingly replaced their teeth — including their long canines — repeatedly throughout their lifetime. “Mammals today, for the most part, just have one replacement cycle of teeth,” Angielczyk said. “Whereas gorgonopsians and other therapsids generally were more like a crocodile today, where they have teeth that are erupting continuously.” Paleontologists discovered bones of the newfound gorgonopsian in Mallorca, a Mediterranean island that’s part of Spain, during expeditions in 2019 and 2021, said senior study authorJosep Fortuny, leader of the computational biomechanics and evolution of life history research group at the Miquel Crusafont Catalan Institute of Paleontology in Spain. “The most interesting thing about the specific specimen that we describe is its age. It is pretty certainly the oldest known gorgonopsian” as well as the oldest known therapsid to date, Fortuny told CNN in an email. “There is a big time gap in the fossil record of therapsids, between when they are predicted to have evolved based on our knowledge of relationships of synapsids (a larger vertebrate group that includes therapsids) and when they actually show up in the fossil record,” Fortuny said. Scientists have previously calculated that therapsid fossils should start showing up in rocks that are about 300 million years old, “and we don’t actually see them, up until now, until about 270 million years ago,” Angielczyk said. The new specimen, which dates back at least to that point in time and is likely even older, aligns with that gap, helping researchers to clarify when therapsids evolved. Fine-tuning the evolution of therapsids during the early part of thePermian Period(299 million to 252 million years ago) is particularly important for tracing the ancestry of mammals, saidRoger Benson, Macaulay Curator of Dinosaur Paleobiology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “Everything from the early Permian on the mammal line is outside of this group Therapsida, and all our knowledge of therapsids comes from the middle Permian and later,” said Benson, who was not involved in the research. “But paleontologists have long suspected there were therapsids before the middle Permian — we just didn’t find their fossils yet. This fossil is the most promising candidate for an early Permian therapsid so far.” The location of the find was also unusual. Gorgonopsid fossils were previously known only from arid, high-latitude sites in South Africa and Russia, the study authors reported. During the Permian, Mallorca was smack in the middle of thesupercontinent Pangea, which existed from 335 million to 200 million years ago. In this equatorial zone, what’s now Mallorca would have experienced very wet and very dry seasons. Related articleAncient ‘terror birds’ were giant apex predators. Suspected new species is among the largest ever known “One of the things people have wondered is if maybe important events in mammal ancestry took place in the tropics, and we’ve been missing fossils of these types of animals at the right age to know about that,” Benson said. “That’s one of the intriguing implications of this fossil, is the potential that important events in mammal ancestry occurred at lower latitudes in environments that we haven’t sampled so much in the fossil record.” Finding the oldest documented gorgonopsian in Mallorca hints that the earliest therapsid fossils are yet to be discovered in places where paleontologists previously didn’t look for them, Angielczyk said. “It’s long been thought that the big temporal gap in the therapsid fossil record might correspond to more geographic sampling,” he said. “The fact that Mallorca is a new place for finding therapsids helps to support that idea that we’re not necessarily looking in the right places to find the first therapsids.” Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.",Science
"Grisly remains point to a bleak, ancient chapter in British history",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/science/bronze-age-britain-massacre/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Thousands of ancient butchered human bones found in a deep shaft in southwest England have pointed archaeologists to a grim chapter of British prehistory that occurred during the Early Bronze Age. Analysis of the more than 3,000 bones has suggested that unidentified assailants violently killed at least 37 men, women and children before butchering and cannibalizing their victims between 2210 and 2010 BC at a site called Charterhouse Warren, which is located in Somerset. Then, the attackers tossed the remnants of the bodies down a 49.2-foot (15-meter) natural shaft linked to a cave system. Related article‘Britain’s Pompeii’ reveals Bronze Age village frozen in time The grisly find represents the largest example of interpersonal violence from this period in Britain, according to the authors of a study describing the findings, which published Sunday in the journalAntiquity. The bones are rare, direct evidence that point to a cycle of violence at a time during the Early Bronze Age that experts had once considered to be largely peaceful in Britain. Most of the hundreds of human skeletons recovered from 2500 to 1500 BC in the country typically have not contained evidence of brutality, the study authors said. “We actually find more evidence for injuries to skeletons dating to the Neolithic period (10,000 BC to 2,200 BC) in Britain than the Early Bronze Age, so Charterhouse Warren stands out as something very unusual,” said lead study author Rick Schulting, professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at the University of Oxford, in a statement.“It paints a considerably darker picture of the period than many would have expected.” The researchers believe the intent behind the extreme treatment of the victims’ remains was to dehumanize them as revenge after some perceived grievous offense. But trying to determine the exact motive from unknown attackers during a time before written documents existed in the region is proving difficult. Excavations took place at the Charterhouse Warren shaft, which is part of a limestone plateau, in the 1970s and 1980s as part of an effort to better understand the subterranean cave system. There, researchers unearthed piles of buried human bones, mixed in with cattle bones, that told the story of mass violence striking an ancient community. Multiple studies have covered the site and its contents since their discovery. But the find drew Schulting’s attention in 2016 thanks to his colleague and study coauthor Dr. Louise Loe, head of Oxford Archaeology’s Heritage Burial Services, who excavates and analyzes human skeletons from archaeological sites. Loe had studied the remains and knew Schulting was interested in documenting evidence of prehistoric violence. “We examined some of the material together and it quickly became clear that the extent of modifications to the bones were far beyond what either of us had ever seen,” Schulting said. “So the project developed to tell the story of the site.” An analysis of the bones revealed that many of the skulls showed fatal impacts from blunt force trauma, but the violence didn’t end there. Numerous cutmarks covering the bones and fractures at or near the time of death showed that the victims’ heads, arms, feet and legs had been removed from their bodies using stone tools. There was also evidence to show that their scalps and skin had been removed, as well as some heads with removed lower jaws and potentially tongues. “In addition, a small number of small bones of the hands and feet exhibit fresh bone crushing fractures that are consistent with the flat molars of omnivores, including humans, rather than the sharper punctures caused by carnivores,” the authors wrote in the study, noting that the body parts were buried quickly after being butchered and cannibalized, making scavenging by animals highly unlikely. The bone analysis also showed that almost all of the victims were local to the area, suggesting that the attackers invaded the community to carry out their brutal acts. What’s more, the extreme manner in which the remains were handled is beyond what Schulting and his colleagues have seen from remains of ancient animals who were butchered. “The most surprising thing is the sheer extent of the butchery of the bodies,” Schulting said. “They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed apart.” The researchers believe the bones are all from a single event. But given that there are different layers of material found within the shaft, the animal and human remains within it may have been deposited “over decades and up to a century or so is possible,” according to the study. “The location itself may be the common denominator; the natural shaft and large underlying cave system inviting comparisons with a portal to the underworld,” the study authors wrote. But the biggest question is why this community was brutalized in the first place. In order to glean the reasons, the team looked back over time for similar violent events. For context, the researchers looked to the nearbyPaleolithic site of Gough’s Cavein Cheddar Gorge, just 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) to the west. There, prior excavations revealed six individuals whose bones had been dismembered and butchered, including potential human chew marks on hand, foot and rib bones. But there is no evidence that the people who cannibalized them actually killed their victims, implying that the cannibalism was actually a form of funerary ritual, the study authors said. Researchers have found evidence of warfare carried out with bows and arrows at Bronze Age sites, and evidence exists from the Early Neolithic about 1,500 years before Charterhouse when weapons like swords began to appear in the historical record, Schulting said. Related articleThousands of bones and hundreds of weapons reveal grisly insights into a 3,250-year-old battle But the Charterhouse Warren victims showed no signs of putting up a fight, suggesting a substantial part of a community was caught off guard or held captive and massacred, and that how they were dealt with afterward was far different from ritual. There are a few limited examples of victims of violence being buried, like a young male found in a ditch at Stonehenge who was shot multiple times with arrows, according to the study authors. But funeral rituals largely included cremation or burials of multiple individuals together, rather than what was found at Charterhouse Warren. The researchers don’t believe the people were killed as food due to starvation, given the abundant amount of cattle bones found mixed in with the human bones. Instead, the study authors believe cannibalism may have been an extreme form of dehumanizing the victims by “othering” the deceased, or eating their flesh and mixing their bones with cattle bones as a way to liken the victims to animals, the researchers said. Innovations in weaponry, like daggers, suggest that interpersonal violence was occurring at the time in Early Bronze Age Britain, said Barry Molloy, an associate professor in the school of archaeology at University College Dublin. Enemies could be considered “others, people so distant from your group that extreme violence against them became acceptable,” said Molloy, who was not involved in the study. Population turnovers in Britain within the centuries surrounding the event suggest exceptional othering was happening as new groups took over parts of Britain, Molloy said. “How far people in prehistoric Europe were willing to dehumanise and brutalise the othered enemy group is writ large at (Charterhouse Warren),” he said. But what could have necessitated such a dramatic act? The study authors don’t believe the attackers were fighting for control of resources at the site, and climate change didn’t seem to have an impact on conflict in Britain at the time. While it’s impossible to know the ancestry of the attackers, there is no evidence to suggest a clash of communities with different ancestries or ethnicities. Understanding motivations in prehistory before written records existed in Britain is incredibly challenging, Schulting said. But the sheer number of victims means there must have been an even larger number of aggressors, he said. Analysis of DNA from the bones is in progress to determine how closely related the victims were, and the research team also intends to study the animal bones going forward, Schulting said. And there is evidence within the teeth of two of the child victims that they had the plague, based on previous research, although it’s unclear how it may have been linked to the violent episode. “Possibly this was seen as revenge for some transgression,” Schulting said. “Such violent acts can emerge in a climate of anger and fear — there is evidence that some individuals had the plague, which may have contributed to a sense of fear and uncertainty. Tensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings (theft, accusations of witchcraft, and so on) and then escalated out of control.” Related article‘Incredibly fascinating’ Roman, Iron Age and Bronze Age settlements unearthed in UK dig Molloy said that while the theory of a single massacre is compelling, it’s more chilling to think that this phenomenon took place across multiple instances, possibly normalizing cannibalism. “Sometimes a single site can radically change our perceptions, and I think that Charterhouse has the potential to do just that,” Schulting said. “The extreme violence seen here is unlikely to have been an isolated incident. There would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region.”",Science
An owl’s ‘shocking’ color should hinder hunting. Scientists may have figured out why it works,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/science/barn-owl-nocturnal-camouflage-moonlight/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Flying slowly and silently through the night sky, barn owls are majestic nocturnal hunters that successfully prey on rodents scurrying along the ground below. Scientists have long puzzled over a feature that would appear to handicap the bird during its midnight hunts. The plumage on its underbelly and wings is gleaming white, an unusual trait that in theory should make it more difficult for the owl to approach its prey undetected. Unlike the snowy owl, the barn owl lives at latitudes where it doesn’t regularly snow. The barn owl’s paradoxically bright plumage baffledbiologistJuanjo Negroand his colleagues, who thought the intriguing biological phenomenon warranted further investigation. “We started from the intuitive feeling that the outstanding whiteness of the barn owl is so shocking that it should imply some adaptive advantage,” said Negro, a research professor at Doñana Biological Station–Spanish National Research Council in Seville, Spain, via email. Previous research from September 2019had suggested that bright white coloration was essentially a form of shock and awe, exploiting rodents’ aversion to bright light. Making the predator more visible to the rodent prey, which freeze in fear, the owls’ whiteness made voles easier to kill, the prior study found. Negro and his team’s latest research suggests instead that the barn owl’s brilliant white plumage is in fact a form of nocturnal camouflage or counter-illumination that gives the hunter an element of surprise. The bird’s white reflective underside effectively mimics moonlight, according to the new study describing the team’s findings that published in the journalPNASon Monday. The bright plumage allows its silhouette to blend into the nocturnal sky and makes it harder for mice or other rodents to spot the owl. “When the moon is visible, the sky has some brightness that varies depending on the observing direction. Under these conditions, a dark bird would be seen by its potential prey as a black silhouette against the sky,” said Negro, the study’s lead author. “But, if the ventral part of the bird is reflective enough, in other words if it is ‘white’ enough, it would reflect a good part of the moon.” According to the researchers’ calculations, the contrast between the reflective, white undersides of barn owls and wide areas of the illuminated night sky falls below the detection threshold of rodent visual acuity, allowing barn owls to approach prey to within a few meters from a broad range of directions without being detected. “This explanation has not been proposed before to justify the whiteness of barn owls,” Negro added. A similar phenomenon exists in the ocean, where fish often have light-colored undersides to match sunlit water and make them less visible to predators hovering in the depths below. Not all barn owls have white underbellies, however; some have reddish-brown plumage instead. Negro said the research did not investigate hunting success in relation to plumage color, but earlier research had suggested that whiter barn owls were more efficient hunters than their darker counterparts during a full moon. Barn owl expertAlexandre Roulin, a professor of biology at the University of Lausanne’s department of ecology and evolution who conducted the prior research that suggested the species’ white coloration shocked and immobilized its prey, said he was not fully convinced by the new explanation. However, he said he couldn’t rule it out. “We do not wish to dismiss the authors’ hypothesis outright. It may, in fact, be complementary to our own. Perhaps at long distances the white plumage aids in camouflage, while at closer range, it may serve to make the owl more visible,” he said via email. One key aspect Roulin said needed further explanation was the behavior of voles under moonlight. “We observed that voles remained immobile longer when the approaching owl was white rather than reddish. Previous research has shown that this immobilization is an anti-predator response,” Roulin said. “Based on this, we would argue that the voles recognized the white owl as a predator, suggesting that the owl was visible, rather than camouflaged.” Negro said the owl’s ability to fly in complete silence, a trait that helps it approach prey in stealth, does not tally with the idea that the predator would want to make itself more visible. However, he agreed that the new hypothesis doesn’t totally disprove the previous theory. Camouflage is often considered a daytime phenomenon based on light and shade. Negro said that there are likely other forms of animal coloration that served as nighttime camouflage, which has not been as well studied as daytime concealment tactics. “Nocturnal ecology is an emerging field, and considering that half the animals in the planet are essentially nocturnal, adaptations to the natural cycles of the Moon are surely widespread,” he said.",Science

Cheer yourself up with our lasttravelnews roundup of 2024. A spectacular new cable car has opened in Switzerland’s Bernese Alps. The Schilthorn Cableway takes riders up to the mountaintop revolving restaurant made famous in the James Bond movie “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” Its makers say it’s thesteepest in the world, climbing 775 meters (2,543 feet) in just four minutes at a gradient of 159.4%. It connects the village of Stechelberg with the car-free village of Mürren, some 1,650 meters (5,413 feet) above sea level. The cableway hasn’t been recognized by Guinness World Records yet, but Switzerland is no stranger to high-altitude record-breakers.

The tourist attractions you can’t visit in 2025,https://www.cnn.com/travel/global-tourist-attractions-closed-2025/,"Global travel has never been as easy as it is today. More plane routes than ever before now link an unprecedented list of destinations, connecting people and cultures in new ways. However, while it may seem like the whole world is an open buffet for tourism, not everything available in the past is still on the travel menu. Some attractions and institutions disappeared in 2024, some a result of natural disasters, others because of financial challenges or simply a change personal preference. Here are two handfuls of places youcan’tvisit in 2025 — or, probably, ever again. Two casino-hotels left the Las Vegas skyline this year —the Tropicanaand the Mirage.The Mirage, which opened in 1989, will be replaced by a new Hard Rock property shaped like a giant guitar. Meanwhile, the Tropicana was pulled down in October to make space for a stadium for the Oakland Athletics baseball team, which is relocating to Sin City. Plan B:In 2024, Sphere transformed the Las Vegas Strip. The giant LED-lit orb isa futuristic events venuethat kicked off with a series of concerts by U2. CNN’s Brandon Griggs, who visited on opening weekend, described it as “like being in a giant planetarium, a juiced-up IMAX theater or maybe VR without the headset.” An iconic drag club has said adieu to Paris’ Montmartre neighborhood. The club,Chez Michou, cited financial difficulties following the death of owner Michel “Michou” Catty in 2020 as its reason for closing. Catty was a well-known figure in France whose death was publicly mourned by no less than President Emmanuel Macron, and Chez Michou was the inspiration for the musical “La Cage aux Folles.” Plan B:Just off the Champs-Elysees, Crazy Horse is one of the hottest tickets for burlesque and cabaret performances in Paris, hosting stars like Lisa from Blackpink and Dita Von Teese. 2024 was a difficult year for New York City’s art museum scene. The Rubin Museum, a Chelsea institution with one of the world’s largest collections of Himalayan art, announced that it would be closing its physical space and becoming a “museum without walls.” The Rubin bid farewell in October, but has said that some of its works — including the popular Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room — will move to the Brooklyn Museum. Plan B:Head to theNicholas Roerich Museum, which is located in an unassuming Upper West Side townhouse. Roerich was a Russian painter who relocated to India and created many paintings of the Himalayan landscape throughout his career. It’s free to enter — and is rarely crowded. The other major art museum saying goodbye to the Big Apple isFotografiska, an offshoot of the Stockholm-based photography museum of the same name. The museum’s last day in operation at its Park Avenue home was September 29, although the owners say they have not given up on New York City and hope to move into another location. Plan B:TheInternational Center of Photography’s museum on the Lower East Side hosts talks, screenings and book signings in addition to photo exhibitions. It’s also close to theTenement Museumand theMuseum of Chinese in America, putting a world of culture in a single afternoon’s itinerary. The Wayfarers Chapel, a National Historic Register-listed glass church in southern California, is a victim of climate change. Designed by Lloyd Wright, son of Frank Lloyd Wright, the structure was at serious risk from landslides in the area. As a result, the trustees made the decision todissemble the chapeland keep it in storage until another home can be found. Plan B:About 40 miles west of Ranchos Palos Verdes, in the Orange County town of Garden Grove, sitsChrist Cathedral, often referred to as “the crystal cathedral” due to its reflective glass building materials. Its striking design was inspired by a four-pointed star. In Japan’s former capital, women still training as traditional geishas have become as much a tourist attraction as the buildings where they live, much to the chagrin of residents of Kyoto’s historic Gion neighborhood. To try and cut back the flow of “geisha paparazzi,” earlier this year the Gion local council voted to block off many of the side streets and alleys, although major thoroughfares will remain open to the public. Plan B:Tourists who want to learn more about geisha culture are encouraged to do so at locally-run organizations. TheGion Kagai Art Museum, which opened in 2024, has exhibits about geishas, daily performances, and opportunities to take pictures with geishas and maikos (their apprentices). Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen also founded this Seattle museum, which was filled with objects from his own personal collection of vintage computers and tech devices. The museum was unusual in that it encouraged visitors to touch, use, and play with everything on display. Following Allen’s death in 2018 and the pandemic two years later, the Living Computers museum was put on hiatus before closing entirely in 2024. The objects from the museum will be auctioned off. Plan B:Allen supported many institutions around the Emerald City, including theMuseum of Pop Culture. The museum is a colorful mix of different cultural reference points and is also home to the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area lost one of its flagship attractions in 2024 whenthe “double arch” collapsed. Staff at the GCNRA said that the rock formation, made of Navajo sandstone dating back about 190 million years, collapsed due to erosion and water level changes. Plan B:Utah has no shortage of beautiful natural landmarks:Arches National Parkhas become so popular that a timed entry system and other overcrowding measures have been introduced in the past few years. But at state parks likeCoral Pink Sand Dunes,Goblin Valleyand theGreat Salt Lake, there are Instagram views a-plenty without the masses.

Visitors swell the ‘surf capital of the Philippines’,https://www.cnn.com/travel/siargao-surf-capital-philippines-sustainable-tourism/,"Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance withour policy. Siargao’s global reputation as the “surf capital of the Philippines” dates back to 1980, when surf photographer Tony Arruza and surfer Steve Jonesvisited the islandin their quest for the “perfect wave.” They hit the jackpot. These pioneering surf explorers spread the word about the area’s abundance of glass-barreled breaks, drawing surf enthusiasts to General Luna, the coastal town that serves as the gateway to many of Siargao’s attractions. In the years following, American surfer and international fugitive Mike Boyum is said to have discovered the island’s now-famous Cloud 9 reef break, and surfing photographer John Callahan shot legends like Kevin Davidson, Evan Slater and Taylor Knox riding the powerful waves. Today, the island’s magnetic energy — a blend of natural beauty, community and adventure — continues to attract visitors to the southeastern Philippines, with numbers growing exponentially each year. Tourism has soared from roughly13,600international arrivals in 2012 to nearly 54,000in 2023. Domestic travel has surged, too, jumping from almost 124,000 visitors in2018to over 476,000 in2023— a staggering increase for an island with around 150,000 residents. And more changes are coming, including a cruise terminal, airport expansions and larger resort developments. “While it’s great to see Siargao gain recognition, it’s crucial to preserve the island’s natural beauty and tight-knit community,” says Wemar Bonono, 28, a pro surfer and the co-founder of Pacifico Surf Bayay, Bigwish Surf School, Pacifico Surf School, Swell Snackbar and The Sun Crew charity. “We’ve seen what’s happened in other island destinations. As long as we prioritize sustainability, eco-friendly initiatives and responsible tourism, Siargao can thrive without losing its charm.” Bonono is part of a growing movement of residents committed to protecting Siargao’s essence while inviting like-minded travelers to share in its beauty through sustainable stays, voluntourism and immersive cultural experiences. These are some of the dedicated individuals working to preserve the island’s magic. Ian Sermonia and Mike Medina, high school friends from Manila, set out in 2013 to open a surf resort that combined their love of hospitality and surfing. “After searching all over the Philippines to find the right place for Harana, we fell in love with Siargao,” Sermonia tells CNN Travel. “The island opened its heart to us the most.” WhenHarana Surf Resortlaunched in 2015, Sermonia and Medina became the first Filipinos from Manila to open a surf resort there. However, as big city transplants, they still tried to integrate into the local community. “Most of the first resorts were owned by foreigners who respected the local culture and just wanted to live the island life — surfing, hanging in nature and just enjoying the waves,” says 44-year-old Sermonia. Related articleIt’s one of the world’s largest connected coral reef systems, but few people have even heard of it That strong foundation of slow living and sustainability in the island’s small but growing hospitality industry resonated with the two men, offering a sharp contrast to cautionary tales from other popular local destinations. “Growing up, Boracay was one of our favorite destinations to spend our holidays and summer breaks,” he recalls. “And then we just saw it take a wrong turn. We were really conscious of that.” Sermonia and Medina consultedSTOKE Certified, a sustainability certification body specializing in surf and ski tourism. “In addition to protecting the environment, they advised us to promote the local culture and make sure that the locals felt that they were part of the growth of Siargao,” he says. For example, the resort hires locals, pays fair wages, gives discounts to guests who volunteer on the island, champions environmental protection and partners with local charities and nonprofits. They also ensure the community feels included at their famous Saturday beach parties, creating a social space where residents and travelers mingle. “That’s what keeps the vibe cool,” Sermonia says. “It’s not just tourists — it’s everyone together.” Growing up in Siargao, Bonono spent his days on a stretch of white sand called Big Wish Beach in Pacifico, a quiet village about an hour up the coast from General Luna. Curious but lacking proper equipment, 9-year-old Bonono improvised with plywood until he could borrow a surfboard from friends. He much preferred surfing to school, where he dropped out at age 10 after bad experiences. “I had a tough time in school, which I was embarrassed about,” he says, adding that he learned to read when he was 16. “But actually, it’s what inspired me to start The Sun Crew.” Founded in 2017, The Sun Crew is a local charity that teaches children to surf, provided they attend school and join weekend beach clean-ups. Bonono and a friend, Australian expat Hannah Bowyer, started the initiative after noticing kids skipping school to watch tourists surf. “I realized we could use surfing as an incentive to get them back in school,” he says. What began as a small initiative has grown to support over 1,000 children from nearby villages, expanding to include summer school, literacy programs, math tutoring, plastic-collection initiatives and young women’s leadership development. “They are the island’s future, so we want to help them combine their interest in surfing with education and instill environmental values, too,” he shares. The Sun Crewalso welcomes travelers who want to volunteer while they’re in Siargao, Bonono adds. “The island has this incredible spirit where the locals and visitors come together, sharing a deep respect for the waves, nature and each other,” he says. “This sense of belonging really sets Siargao apart – the strong surfing culture and this shared passion to protect this paradise.” Originally from Manila, Kara Rosas arrived in Siargao in 2019 for a three-month volunteer stint atBayatakan Farm Experience, a hands-on farming and cultural immersion initiative. While volunteering, she met owner Analyn Dulpina, who had partnered with a local snackbar up in Burgos, one of the northernmost towns on the island. “The snackbar is a social enterprise — it’s a community space where people can gather around a snack, far from the main tourism area,” says Rosas, 27, who helped formalize the projects into an organization called Lokal Lab. “While running the snackbar, Mark (Pintucan) and Iris (Aroa) wanted to ensure that at least 80% of what they served actually came from the island. That’s when we found out that there was a problem of food security in the sense that 97% of the island’s produce was imported, even though there are a lot of farms here.” To address the issue, they teamed up with Dulpina to launch a slow-food market in General Luna where buyers, like restaurants and hotels, could connect with local producers. By providing an economic ecosystem for local produce, Rosas says, Lokal Lab hopes to sustain traditional livelihoods like weaving and farming. Otherwise, she worries that rapid tourism development will cause locals to sell their land or be forced to leave due to rising prices. “They’re the food producers and the backbone of tourism — and we don’t want them to be ostracized from development,” Rosas adds. “That’s what happened in Bali … When visiting or moving to the island, we need to be careful not to gentrify it and be mindful about the island’s existing culture.” On a mission to make Siargao a self-sustaining island, Lokal Lab also trains farmers in regenerative techniques, supports local artisans and hosts a youth-led storytelling initiative. Travelers can experience Lokal Lab’s work atThe Hub, a social enterprise in General Luna. Set inside a renovated Filipino house, the community space and cafe showcases farm-to-table cuisine alongside immersive events and workshops. It’s also the meeting point for Lokal Experience tours, which include hands-on farming experiences, cooking and traditional weaving experiences. The organization’s latest project, Tropical Academy, is a vocational school teaching regenerative farming, with plans to add carpentry, culinary and hospitality skills. “The idea is to empower locals so they don’t have to leave their communities for jobs,” she says. “We want them to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to start their own businesses and take control of their own livelihoods.” Siargao is home to the Philippines’ largest mangrove stand, spanning over 4,800 hectares and providing shelter to rare and endangered species such as crocodiles, sea turtles and the Philippine cockatoo. While the island and its surrounding waters have been designated a protected area since 1996, enforcement remains a challenge. “When I go to the main island, I have noticed some changes — especially issues with waste management and plastic pollution,” Lady Carmel Litang tells CNN Travel. “The more tourists that arrive on the island, the more plastic waste comes.” The 25-year-old joined the nonprofit SEA Movement, which stands for Siargao Environmental Awareness, in 2022. Related articlePhilippines dream journey: Exploring Palawan’s stunning islands on a traditional fishing boat The organization aims to inspire collective action and environmental stewardship through beach cleanups, advocating for plastic-free alternatives, and educating locals and tourists on marine conservation. Born and raised on Halian Island, off the west coast of Siargao, Litang also leads Halian SEAwikan, a turtle-nesting conservation program, and Saturday beach clean-ups with local island kids. She also collaborates with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office of Surigao Del Norte to conduct turtle conservation workshops in Halian and parts of Siargao. Litang says the government and many other organizations are working on waste-management solutions, but travelers must also be mindful of their choices. “There are some irresponsible tourists we can’t control,” she adds. “But we are just hoping that the travelers who come here will be responsible and eco-conscious — that they travel to support the local communities.” Despite the challenges of rapid tourism development, there’s hope among Siargao’s residents. After thedevastation of Typhoon Rai, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Odette, in December 2021, donations have poured into the region, providing a much-needed boost for the island’s restoration. Moreover, a “Comprehensive Tourism Master Plan” was developed back in 2017 to provide a roadmap for balanced growth, but it hasn’t been implemented yet. “It’s really unfortunate — it would have tackled key issues like rising tourism, power shortages, waste management and disaster resilience,” Felino A. Palafox, Jr., the award-winning Filipino architect whose namesake firm is behind the plan, tells CNN Travel. “The government needs to implement the plan quickly — every new structure in Siargao should go above and beyond the building code to withstand super typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis.” CNN Travel has reached out to the DENR for comment but did not receive a reply prior to publishing. Sermonia agrees that the master plan would push Siargao in a positive direction. “The community is strong, but leadership must prioritize sustainable practices,” he says. “Politicians will ultimately decide where Siargao goes.” For now, Sermonia says, Siargao is at a tipping point. “Hundred-room resorts aren’t necessarily bad if they’re eco-friendly and locals feel like they’re part of the growth,” he notes. “At the end of the day, I truly believe that alongside the warmth of the locals, it’s the surf culture and its deep respect for the environment and nature that sets the island apart. If politicians continue valuing and protecting this culture, Siargao will be in a good place.” Bonono echoes this sentiment. “The community is making great strides — there’s a genuine investment in preserving the island’s beauty while ensuring growth benefits everyone,” he says. “It’s inspiring to see some of the work being done to help the island evolve from not just a surfing paradise but also a model for a sustainable, inclusive community, and we look forward to seeing more people join this mission.”",World
The tiny island that sits between Europe and Asia,https://www.cnn.com/travel/maidens-tower-istanbul-kiz-kulesi/,"Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance withour policy. The great and ancient city of Istanbul – formerly Constantinople, formerly New Rome, formerly Byzantium – straddles two continents. The European side extends like a finger across the Bosphorus Strait, almost but not quite touching its Asian counterpart. The strait is just 700 meters wide at its narrowest point, so the two continents are held permanently just a breath apart, like Adam reaching to God in Michaelangelo’s “Creation of Man.” In these twinkling blue waters, connecting the small inland Sea of Marmara with the vast waters of the Black Sea, a tiny island of rock has been inhabited nearly as long as the city itself, a crucial outpost between two worlds. Today it’s known as Kız Kulesi, or Maiden’s Tower, and over the past two-and-a-half millennia it’s served many roles. Built as a customs checkpoint in 410 BCE, it’s been a defense tower, a castle, a lighthouse, a cholera hospital, a radar station, a cyanide storage facility and a self-declared “republic of poetry” for writers. For most of those 2,500 or so years, it’s been a “mystery standing in the middle of the Bosphorus,” says Han Tümertekin, one of the architects behind its recent major two-year restoration. It was somewhere the city faced toward, from both Europe and Asia, but could not visit. In the 21st century, it’s become a tourist attraction where visitors can go to look back at the city. Now, newly reinforced and renovated, the spick-and-span monument-museum reopened to the public once more in March 2024. The starting point for visitors is bustling Karaköy Pier on the European side. Istanbul was theNo. 2 cityin the world for international arrivals in 2024, according to data analytics company Euromonitor International, with an estimated 23 million visitors. A lot of them will end up here on the Golden Horn, milling in and out of seafood restaurants and bars, people-watching as boats sail up and down the glistening waterway, under the celebrated Galata Bridge, with the Rüstem Pasha Mosque commanding the horizon. “Each year, around 30,000 ships cross the strait,” historian and travel writerSaffet Emre Tonguc, tells CNN Travel. “It’s one of the busiest straits in the world.” On a sunny Saturday in September, the tourist boat is laden with customers as CNN makes the short and scenic trip over to where Kız Kulesi sits at the southern end of the Bosphorus, just a short distance from the Üsküdar district on the Asian side. We file off the boat on landing, scale the tower’s new internal staircase one behind the other, and spread out on the viewing platform, cameras in hand, to enjoy this polished piece of history. Related cardTurkey’s Kaçkar Mountains: Unspoiled land of alpine adventure In its first incarnation as a customs point, a tower was built to inspect ships coming from the Black Sea and to collect taxes. “It’s just standing at the entrance. It’s like the Statue of Liberty,” says Tonguc. “When you enter New York Harbor, you see the Statue of Liberty. And here you see the Maiden Tower.’ “Today, the Black Sea is very important […] because of petrol and natural gas,” says private tour guideBarış Partal. “In the past, it was gold, silver and copper, because the Georgian mountains were full of them — they still are — and the people who came from Greece in the ancient times, they wanted to travel the Bosporus to collect the stuff then come back.” The Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts, where the men must pass through Hellespont landing to stock up on supplies, is closely linked to this, says Partal, though transposed to a different location. In the 12th century, a defense tower was built on the island during the reign of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and a chain was stretched out to a second tower to control the passage of ships. After the Ottoman conquest of 1453, Sultan Mehmed II had the wooden tower fortified as a stone castle. From the late 17th century, after the addition of a lantern on the northern part of the tower, its primary function was as a lighthouse. “It’s not very deep, but the Maiden Tower area is very sharp,” says Partal. Some of the tower’s more unusual uses have been as a quarantine hospital during cholera outbreaks in the 1830s, its isolation from the mainland city  making it an excellent choice. For a brief time while it was under Turkey’s Maritime and Port management in the 1980s it served as a storage facility for cyanide. Shortly after that, in May 1992, the tower was used by poets who declared it a “Republic of Poetry.” The “pearl of the Bosphorus,” as the tower is sometimes known, has no shortage of its own mythology, however. The most famous legend is about a king who is warned by a fortune teller that his daughter will die of a snake bite, so he builds the tower to protect her and sends her baskets of food. However, a snake finds its way to the island in a basket of fruit and kills her with its venomous bite. Says Partal, “You cannot escape from your destiny, that is the message.” Another legend links the tower to Ovid’s Leander, which is why the tower is also sometimes called Leander’s Tower. In this tragic tale, Leander swims there each night to meet his lover, but one fateful night is drowned. Upon learning of his death, she too takes her own life. There is even a legend that the Maiden’s Tower is in a loving relationship with the Galata Tower, another famed Istanbul structure. “They are a matching couple,” says Tonguc, standing out in the cityscape. Related articleIn the world’s most-visited city, here’s a view few tourists have seen The recent restoration is one of many, many changes and fixes to the castle and tower in its long history. It’s been buffeted over the years by earthquakes and fires and even the island on which it stands was reinforced by the addition of large rocks during repairs in the 1940s. This most recent renovation is both to reinforce the structure and to once again reveal earlier architectural details that were lost during 20th-century makeovers. After hopping off the boat, wandering around the castle and the viewpoint and the island base, there isn’t a great deal to do at the tower, other than have a snack at the simple on-site cafe. It’s the work of an hour and once everyone hops back on the boat — which returns to Europe rather than the Asian side just beside us — the island is near-deserted until the next boat arrives. It is, however, a restful break from the hubbub of the city and a unique perspective on this most legendary of cities. A trip there does not come cheap, as is the case with many of Istanbul’s top attractions. It costs 27 euros for entrance plus an extra five euros for the boat (about $33 in total), unless you have an Istanbul Museum Pass, which starts at a hefty 105 euros ($109). Tonguc welcomes the restoration as a necessary step to a building that had been falling into disrepair. Istanbul’s historical monuments “were built in such a robust way,” he says, to resist the onslaught of earthquake, floods and fire over the millennia. “They’re in a great condition because they were built to serve for centuries, not just for a couple of years.” Kiskulesi.gov.tr",World

Travel intelligence companyOAGhas released its annual list of the world’s busiest flight routes — and the 105-minute hop between the two has topped the international route board, with nearly 7 million seats on sale in 2024. The 6,781,577 seatmates have returned the route to its prepandemic popularity — HKG-TPE also topped the board in 2019. It was third last year. Last year’s listwas topped by Singapore-Kuala Lumpur, with a relatively few 4.9 million seats. Second on the 24 list was Cairo-Jeddah, with nearly 5.5 million seats sold. The Egypt-Saudi Arabia route has had an astonishingly swift growth over the past five years, going from ranking 14th in 2019 to second place in 2023 and 2024. Seoul took two of the next spots, with routes to Tokyo Narita and Osaka Kansai coming in at third and fourth respectively. Singapore Changi airport — which had stormed the board in the 2023 rankings — took three spots in the top 10, with routes to Kuala Lumpur (fourth), Jakarta (eighth) and Bangkok (ninth). The Middle East, Europe and even the US got a look in too, with Dubai-Riyadh at number six, and New York JFK-London Heathrow rounding out the top 10. When it comes to domestic routes, the top three globally were all in Asia: Jeju International-Seoul Gimpo, Sapporo New Chitose-Tokyo Haneda, and Fukuoka-Tokyo Haneda. Jeju-Seoul has kept the crown of the world’s busiest domestic route, with 14.2 million seats – nearly 39,000 per day. Analyzing routes per region, Cairo was Africa’s hub, with routes out of the Egyptian capital taking the top five spots for routes leaving the continent.

How ‘The Brutalist’ built architect László Tóth — inside and out,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/style/the-brutalist-adrien-brody-judy-becker-interview/,"In a dark corner of a mansion in mid-century Pennsylvania, Erzsébet, a Hungarian immigrant rebuilding her life in America, pores over the contents of a desk. Scattered across it are sketches and technical drawings for a civic building, a grand folly designed by her husband László, for the wealthy patron whose home they now share. “What are you doing?” László says, walking in. “I’m looking at you,” his wife replies. Years later that building is incomplete, though stands tall in its creator’s mind. A second chance to finish the job presents itself. “Promise me you won’t let it drive you mad?” Erzsébet pleads. Even as László promises he won’t, his voice betrays him. The madness — the obsession — is already there, deep within his marrow. Director Brady Corbet’s film “The Brutalist,” a vast and imposing portrait of fictional architect László Tóth, a Holocaust survivor starting over in the United States, has already achieved near-universal acclaim. A Venice Film Festival winner and Oscar contender, including for Corbet and the movie’s lead actor Adrien Brody, it is both a new American epic and cinematic throwback, running over three-and-a-half hours, plus an intermission , and shot on VistaVision    (a film stock which hasn’t been used by an American movie since 1961). The thrust of the movie is Tóth’s commission to design a public institute   for industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren (Guy Pearce). Tóth, a notable Jewish architect in Europe before World War Two, was interned in a concentration camp and relocates to America in 1947 at the start of the film. Once there, he learns his wife Erzsébet (Felicity Jones) has survived the camps too, and longs to be reunited. Van Buren can assist with this, and help Tóth revive his career, but their relationship and its power imbalance comes at great personal cost. Corbet’s film, written with his partner Mona Fastvold, required not one but two people to embody Tóth: as well as Brody, production designer Judy Becker was charged with imagining then constructing the architect’s work. “I am fortunate to have an understanding of that immigrant experience and the many parallels of an artist’s journey,” said Brody in a video interview with CNN. “My mother is a Hungarian immigrant and emigrated to the United States after 1956 and the revolution in Budapest. There was a lot that I recalled from my youth of my grandparents, of things that were very familiar and very textural that were accessible to me to help shape him,” he added. Brody was “the outward projection — but I was the person writing the poetry,” Becker quipped in a separate video interview. Becker designed everything by Tóth in the movie, from pieces of furniture to a library for Van Buren and his institute. “I do method design in general,” said the designer. “I really tried to think about what (Tóth) had learned and experienced in his life at each moment, and I took that seriously. It’s always a dual process, me and the character, like it is for actors, except I don’t just disappear.” “Some of it’s not going to show on screen,” she added, “but I think it helps make it feel real for the people on set, and that helps it look real on screen.” “(Becker) brought so much to this,” said Brody. “To have the material and the form and the structure and something tangible there to represent all these other layers of his (Tóth’s) storytelling too … is really so meaningful and very artistic.” We learn in the film that Tóth trained at the Bauhaus art school, “the starting point” for the production designer. Becker researched Bauhaus alumni and Modernist and subsequent Brutalist architects. “It wasn’t my first foray into Brutalism. I’ve loved Brutalism since before it was popular,” she said of the divisive movement that utilized unfinished concrete. “He also went through one of the most horrible experiences a human could go through,” she said of the Holocaust, adding researching photographs and schematics of concentration camps “was the hardest part for me.” Both Tóth’s personal and the professional spheres collide in Becker’s design for the institute, which takes on deep symbolic value. The institute, a monolithic concrete structure perched atop a hill, needed to be radical, befitting a designer who can bluntly tell his patron, “You were not prepared for what you saw — it’s understandable.” Becker said she drew on the work of Hungarian-German modernist Marcel Breuer and contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando, among others, for her creation, which is only shown in snatches, preserving its mystique while keeping costs down. (The movie was shot mostly in Hungary on a modest budget   for a feature film, with estimates at $10 million or less.) Two models were made, one two-foot high and made of card, which Tóth presents to Van Buren, and the other an in-camera miniature, about three-foot high and five-foot long. In the third act, as we’re drawn closer to the institute, various real locations were amalgamated, including the József Gruber Water Reservoir  on Gellért Hill in Budapest, and a concrete silo. From above, the building is shaped like a cross, featuring a chapel at its center and wings serving other community functions. “The concentration camps were divided by a road, there were barracks either side, it was very rectilinear,” said Becker. “Everything was kind of in the shape of a cross.” Tóth, she added, “was Jewish and was constantly being forced into this Christian world, even when it came to America. So I wanted that to be a large part of the symbolism, obvious or not.” The silhouette only tells part of the story, however. The building’s interior proportions – odd, impractical – are vital, to the point the architect refuses to budge when he’s advised to change them. Related articleAamir Khan is ready for his next act “I took it further than anyone knows,” said Becker. “I kind of designed it as an almost immersive experience for anyone who went into that building.” Claustrophobic rooms with high ceilings, windowless spaces and narrow stairs were crafted to mimick “the barracks that he and Erzsébet were imprisoned in.” Meanwhile, the central chapel, with its opening in the ceiling, represents a route out. “There was a lot of references to imprisonment and freedom, and the visitor themselves is imprisoned in the building,” she added. “All of that really went into my design of the building, even though I knew it would never be in the movie.” The institute becomes the embodiment of Tóth’s struggle, his enduring love for his wife, and a reckoning with his trauma. It’s also deeply subversive, in that it’s slipped inside the passion project of Van Buren, a man he comes to rightly loathe. For Tóth, a heroin addict  and rough around the edges, architecture is his most elegant way of communicating. “This Brutalist structure is symbolic of the shell of a man that he is,” said Brody, but also representative of a “spiritual quest.” Cinema has made architects its subject before, but creator and creation are frequently at a disjuncture. Megalomanic architect Howard Roark in King Vidor’s “The Fountainhead” (1949) is a man ultimately larger than his on-screen creations. Anthony Royal in Ben Wheatly’s Ballard adaptation “High Rise” (2015) is a cypher for free market capitalism more than a creative force. Cesar Catalina, the architect in Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis” (2024), is a Nobel Prize-winner, but that’s the prime indicator of his genius, not what we’re shown (unless you’re wowed by travelators). “Is there a better description of a cube than that of its construction?” This question, posed by Tóth midway through the film, highlights the pitfalls of using one artform to depict another — and helps explain why cinema sometimes falls short in portraying architecture. All too often what’s rendered is a pale shadow of the real thing. “The Brutalist” succeeds in part because the architecture is impressive. But also because it inverts Tóth’s question: It imagines a structure which sums up its subject ­— a man otherwise unable to describe himself. For all theemotional turmoil of creatives being creative littered throughout cinema – and there is plenty of that in “The Brutalist” — Corbet and his collaborators also make space to highlight the grace, catharsis and redemption the act can offer too. Brody had plenty of sympathy for his character. “Part of what makes the film so special is that it parallels the journey and the yearnings of an artist,” said the actor. “All artists, whether it’s an architect or a photographer or an actor or a painter, are somehow pushing to break past those boundaries and to build something of lasting significance to leave behind,” he continued. “That’s my journey. What motivates me is to find material that speaks to people and shares things on a level that’s much deeper than entertainment. “The beauty of film is to leave behind something indelible.” Poured concrete or celluloid; the artist need only choose their canvas. We see them either way. “The Brutalist” debuts in US cinemas from December 20, and in the UK on January 24.",Society
Look closer at this image and you’ll see what AI can’t,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/style/cursed-charlie-engman-ai-photographs/,"Too many fingers or too many teeth — as generative AI imagery exploded across the internet last year, these bodily mishaps became both a punchline and a tell-tale sign that these photographs weren’t real. Instead, they were a machine’s best-guess at the world through human prompts. The images that went viral were often unnerving: high-flash nostalgicparty picturesof grinning models with extra molars, or portraits of a sobbing Steve Harveysloshing liquorin a pitch-black room. But over the past two years, the Brooklyn-based photographer and director Charlie Engman has been intentionally leaning into the strangeness of AI photographs, generating eerie images — using the program Midjourney — that feel set in the real world but toy with anatomy and gesture in disquieting ways. In his book “Cursed,” a man in a suit steps knee-deep into a shallow puddle in the morning light, swan wings extending from his shoulders. In another image, a woman stares at a ruddy sculptural bust with her own features that seems to be staring back. Limbs morph and disappear altogether, faces are slick and masklike, and inanimate objects resemble human limbs. People hold animals close and sometimes start to become them, the new forms seemingly evolving or decaying. “(AI) does things very wrongly,” Engman explained to CNN in a video call. “It has this tertiary relationship to the physical world, where it’s representing a human’s representation of (it). And so it deconstructs physical gestures and human bodies… in just this really raw and sort of a guttural way.” Sitting with the images can bring on a creeping sense of unease. Some subtly veer from the everyday to the unnatural, like a woman holding a thin blade to her cheek, smiling, eyes locked on the viewer. Others are nightmarish renderings, such as a David Cronenberg-like fetus of both insect and human anatomy. Through “Cursed,” Engman was looking to strike a kind of “balanced dissonance” that felt like an elaboration of his own photography work, he said. “What’s desirable, what’s disgusting, what’s beautiful, what’s ugly — you’re forced to confront, on a feelings level, what those criteria are,” he added. Engman has often played with those tensions across his work. His intensive 15-year collaboration with his mother, “Mom,” probes at the dynamics of both a mother-son and photographer-subject relationship in sometimes uncomfortable ways. Elsewhere, his art direction for the Brooklyn fashion label Collina Strada has seen models both morphing into animals on the runway or barreling down it with unhinged grins. Like many people, Engman was first introduced to AI through the app Lensa, which allowed people to generate stylizedAI self-portraits to share on social media. But after a colleague at Collina Strada showed him his experiments in Midjourney in 2022, Engman was hooked. “It’s like a slot machine, right — you put in a prompt, and then you get something out. And what you get out is not really that important…there was a naive beginner’s joy that I had with it,” Engman recalled of using Midjourney. “I think I was maybe clinically addicted to it. I was up at 2 am (using it).” Because of his ongoing work with his mother, Engman seized on the technology as a new form their collaboration could take, training Midjourney with a set of her images. And though his mother does appear sporadically in the book, including as limbless, moth-winged figure, she’s more of an easter egg for those familiar with Engman’s work, than a focal point. Though “Cursed” does naturally veer into the realm of horror filmmakers, Engman steered clear of visual references and instead began reading texts related to critical disability theory. The questions he found himself raising about the body and ability are reflected in the imagery. “What are the actual limitations of a body? What is a normative body? What are the limitations of a normative body? When does a body start to move out of the normative frame, and what is the threshold?” he posed. “Those are the things that body horror is also talking about, actually probably in a very similar way.” Animals feature, too, with swans, dogs and horses making appearances as fully-formed or disassembled suggestions of creatures. Engman returned to them because the way they rendered was beautiful to him, he explained, but they also have a long history of implied symbolism, too. “They are categorically allegorical animals, so I was able to make poetic conceptual connections between human and non-human,” he said. Because of their use in art, literature and other media, “there’s already an elaborate language for it that people can connect to.” With the acceleration of AI imaging, the book is already a marker of a time that is fading from view. Photography books from concept to print often come together over years, not months. Engman found the technology was moving faster than the project as multiple new updates rolled out for Midjourney — and jumbled features such as six-fingered hands were becoming obsolete. “The first images that I made for the project and the last image I made almost couldn’t co-exist… they were almost on two different registers and that is very interesting to me, too,” he said. “What was so fascinating, and actually was very motivating, is that I was making an out-of-date book. As I’m making the book, it’s already out of sync with what’s happening,” he added. New AI abilities have generally come in bursts, then pause as processing power catches up and breakthroughs are made. There may be a “ceiling” to this new wave of generative AI imagery in how accurately a computer program can understand and depict the world, Engman acknowledged, and he’s curious, not anxious, about what happens next. In the future, the context may be lost for “Cursed,” with anomalous generated bodies just a blip in the larger scheme of faithful AI renderings. Or maybe the next gen of AI swerves us even deeper into the uncanny valley in yet unknown and frightening ways. Either way, Engman wants the book to stand on its own. “There has to be something interesting about the work that’s outside of the technology,” he said. “The technology has to be subservient to the content.”",Science
The origins of the ugly Christmas sweater,https://www.cnn.com/style/ugly-christmas-sweater-holidays-history/,"Move over twinkling fir trees and wreaths, eggnog, stockings and the office secret Santa — there’s a new kid in town. Over the last decade the ugly Christmas sweater has firmly embedded itself in yuletide culture. You know the one. It’s a wooly pullover, usually in different shades of red, white and green, often of questionable fabric, and with at least one Christmas-inspired motif on it — a snowman, tinsel, a reindeer or candy canes. Extra points if it features 3D pom-pom or jingle bells. The garment has quickly become an essential part of the holidays, ubiquitous asChristmas lightsand wrapping paper. It’s obnoxious and tacky, but also fuzzy and kind of wholesome — the fashion equivalent of a Hallmark Christmas movie (with a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek). It took some time for the UCS to find its place in the pantheon of Christmas fundamentals, however. Christmas-themed pullovers started making an appearance in the 1950s, a nod perhaps to the holiday’s growing commercialization. Initially referred to as “Jingle Bell Sweaters,” they weren’t as garish as today’s iterations, and found little popularity in the market, although some TV personalities — notably crooners Val Doonican and Andy Williams — really embraced the ugly side of the festive topper. World’s ‘humblest’ Christmas tree, bought for pennies, sells for $4,000 at auction It wasn’t until the 1980s that the item hit the mainstream. The shift came thanks to pop culture and comedies, with goofball dad characters like Chevy Chase’s Clark Griswold in “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation” turning the holiday sweater into an uncomely but endearing expression of cheer. Snowflake-emblazoned sweaters weren’t considered cool, but they radiated yule, and were sported at office parties and on Christmas Day. The resurgence didn’t last long. In the 1990s the Christmas sweater faded in popularity; it was something only your unfashionable older relatives would ever think of wearing or gifting. By the turn of the new millennium, the item was widely considered an eyebrow-raising sartorial mishap. Think of 2001’s “Bridget Jones’s Diary,” in which Colin Firth’s Mark Darcy turns to greet Bridget (Renée Zellweger) at a family party wearing an unattractive knitted garment featuring a giant red-nosed reindeer. Bridget is horrified. So were you, probably, if you watched it in the cinema. But you probably also smiled. Such is the heartwarming power of the UCS. The early 2000s also saw new life breathed into this now holiday staple. According to the “Ugly Christmas Sweater Party Book: The Definitive Guide to Getting Your Ugly On,” Christmas sweater parties started kicking off just around the time Bridget was recoiling at Darcy’s outfit. The first so themed get-together took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2002, said Brian Miller, one of the book’s authors and founder of online shop UglyChristmasSweaterParty.com, in a phone interview. “It’s hard to say what triggered the change in perspective, but I think that the moment someone wore the garment in a humorous way, people started seeing the comic side of it, and thinking ‘this thing at the back of the closet could be fun, instead of something awful that nobody wants’,” he said. How this surprising Christmas film became a fashion favorite The popularity of the ugly sweater snowballed from there. Over the following decade, the festive knit evolved into “a new holiday tradition,” as Miller described it. “It became our generation’s mistletoe,” he added. “Which is pretty remarkable, when you think about it.” Fast-fashion giants like Topshop and high-end retailers like Nordstrom began filling their shelves and sites with gaudy designs each holiday season. Vintage stores and the Salvation Army capitalized on the trend by upping their stocks of fuzzy snowmen and dancing Santa pullovers. Even the fashion pack came around. In 2007, Stella McCartney released a polar bear-themed alpine sweater. Givenchy followed in 2010, and Dolce & Gabbana the following year. 2012 was a turning point for the ugly sweater craze. UK charity Save the Children launched Christmas Jumper Day, a fundraising event encouraging people to don their most cringeworthy sweaters. British newspaper The Telegraphdescribedthe item as “this season’s must-have,” while the New York Times reported on ugly Christmas sweater-themed runs, pub crawls and specialized e-tailers booming across the States. Concurrently, the knits began showing more tinsel, bells and wacky details, reaching peak kitsch. Celebrities, from Taylor Swift to Kanye West embraced the trend, too. Late night talk show host Jimmy Fallon even started running a regular segment called “12 Days of Christmas Sweaters,” whichstill airs today. First lady Jill Biden unveils White House holiday decorations If anything, the rise of social media has only heightened the “It” status of the ugly sweater. Today, we compete to show off our Christmas-sweater love on Instagram, while anyone from mass retailer Target to fast food chain Red Lobster (whose UCS features a pocket to keep food warm), and more fashion houses offer their own versions of the garment. “When I attended my first Ugly Sweater Party in the early 2000s, I would have never anticipated the garment would take off like this,” Miller said. “Although it’s easy to see why: ugly knits can be worn by anyone — from my daughter at her school’s ugly sweater contest to office workers at their end of year party. They’re democratic. And they’re a lot of fun. Christmas can be quite stressful — wearing something ridiculous can help take the pressure off.” This article was first published in December 2019.",Society
Look of the Week: Nicole Kidman is bringing this 9-5 staple to the celebrity circuit,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/style/nicole-kidman-babygirl-pinstriped-suit/,"Nicole Kidman has officially clocked into the press tour for her latest film, “Babygirl,” and she’s dressed for business. On Monday evening, the actor — who plays a high-powered executive in Halina Reijn’s movie, out Christmas Day in the US — arrived at the Late Show with Stephen Colbert in a fitted black pinstriped suit with a double-breasted blazer. After the taping, Kidman furthered her case for employee of the month by switching out her sheer blouse for an official“Babygirl” T-shirt from A24’s merchandise store. But Kidman isn’t the only A-lister to embrace the humble stripe. This week, a throughline has emerged — from Rihanna running errands in LA wearing a striped Bottega Veneta set, to Elle Fanning showing up to a London photocall for “A Complete Unknown” in a Saint Laurent pinstripe shirt (paired with beige wide-leg slacks and a navy tie). The iconic pattern — most deftly demonstrated in Kidman’s suit — can be traced at least as far back as the Medieval era. One of the earliest mentions of pinstriping in literature comes from Geoffrey Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales,” written in the 14th century, where the English writer described a barrister who was wearing a homely coat “girt with a silken belt ofpin-stripe stuff.” By the Victorian era, suits decorated with single-weft lines had become a staple among the British banking class, but the style of stripes was less about form than function. Each bankreportedlyowned a particular colorway or fabric, while the thickness and spacing of the stripes themselves delineated a person’s rank within the company. Related articleLook of the Week: Pamela Anderson’s still repping her bare face There’s a certain irony in the fact that those on the celebrity circuit — who appear to hover above the mundanity and misery of cubicle working and employee dress codes — are embracing this staunch symbol of corporate professionalism. But they aren’t alone. Despite the rise of work from home culture decimating the need for old-school office wear, there is an appetite for a more playful version of 9-5 style. This year, Gen Z fetishized pinstripes, gray tailoring and denier tights with the “office siren” microtrend — a phrase that has48,000 videos attached to it on TikTok, with some racking up millions of views. At the Saint Laurent show in September, the same collection Fanning found her Monday night outfit, creative director Anthony Vaccarello honed in on the power suit — designing them with huge ‘80s shoulders, pinstriped shirts and jewel-toned ties. Fashion houses LaQuan Smith, Nina Ricci and Antonio Marras similarly followed suit, offering up pinstripe tailoring reimagined either in mini dresses or exaggerated silhouettes. Thankfully for her, Kidman won’t be needing to apply for a real office job anytime soon. But dressed in her pinstriped suit she looks every bit the “Babygirl”-boss.",Entertainment

A tribunal in Tasmania’s capital city Hobart subsequently ruled that the Ladies Lounge must “cease refusing entry to persons who do not identify as ladies.” Kaechele opted to close the Lounge, rather than opening it to men. But the tribunal was not counting on the determination of Kaechele, who swiftly appealed its decision in the supreme court. Kaecheleturned up to the hearingwith a power-dressed, choreographed cohort of female supporters in bright red lipstick. Related articleA man’s world? Art exhibit about misogyny was only open to women — until a man complained In September the supreme court quashed the tribunal’s ruling, and MONA this week announced that the Ladies Lounge will reopen for a lap of honor from Thursday until mid-January, 2025. Once again, the champagne will flow for any lady who cares to step inside. As for men, they are still barred. But a ballot on MONA’s app, The O, will give a small number of men the opportunity to enter the feminine space of the Ladies Lounge for “domestic arts lessons and other reparations,” the museum said. Despite Ladies Lounge’s pending closure, Kaechele stated it is a “living artwork” and hinted that a pop-up version might yet be seen “anywhere at any time, especially in centers of male power.” In a statement, Kaechele welcomed visitors back to the installation, writing: “Through the court case, the Ladies Lounge has transcended the art museum and come to life. People from all over the world have been invited to contemplate the experiences of women throughout history and today. “It is time to celebrate in the place where it all began — with the dedicated adoration of our butlers and copious amounts of champagne to toast this incredible chapter!” A selection of new works and performances will be on display in the Ladies Lounge but, wishing to maintain the element of surprise, MONA has not disclosed full details. The museum said, in a statement: “Entry for ladies, and exclusion for men, is included as part of the museum entry ticket.” To mark the Lounge’s final days, Kaechele commissioned a new, limited-edition fragrance called “The Verdict.” “The fragrance features an elegant bouquet of fine florals, lush green stems, juicy citrus and a hint of spice,” the MONA statement said.

"Vagus nerve stimulation may relieve treatment-resistant depression, study finds",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/health/vagus-nerve-stimulation-depression-treatment-wellness/,"Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter.Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. Nick Fournie was 24 years old whensevere depression upendedhis life. Fournie had been married to his longtime sweetheart for two years, and had no reason to suspect he had any mental health issues. “I just thought to myself, ‘If this is it, if this is all there is to life — if it ended now, I’d be OK with it,’” Nick, now 62 and based in Illinois, said of that fateful day outdoors nearly 40 years ago. But one day as he was mowing the lawn, his perspective on life abruptly flipped from light to dark. The shift would set him and his wife, Mary, on a tumultuous, yearslong journey of fighting for his well-being and another chance at a happy life together — until they learned of an alternative, obscure treatment that would change everything. Related articleWhat experts say about taking psilocybin as an alternative treatment for depression Over the next decade, Nick worked with a psychiatrist to find a medication that would alleviate his depression. Not only did the 10 or so drugs he tried fail to improve his condition — they also caused “terrible reactions,” Mary said, especially when he was prescribed more than one drug at once. Nick has always been sensitive to medications, but he likenedthe side effectshe experienced to “psychotic episodes.” Although he believed the psychiatrist was doing his best, “some of (the drugs) really sent me way out of my mind,” he said. On some days he wasn’t functioning, and even experienced paranoia that kept him from leaving the house, Mary said. Nick was generally able to keep working but couldn’t feel happiness about anything, he said. “Every single day seemed like it was two days.” Nearly 20 years ago, knowing all other options had failed, Nick’s sister, a nurse, recommended he check out a new treatment called vagus nerve stimulation, or VNS. The US Food and Drug Administrationhad just approved VNSin 2005 for the long-term adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in adults who had had inadequate responses to at least four antidepressant treatments. The vagus nerve “has over 100,000 individual nerves in a bundle,” said neuroscientist Dr. Bashar Badran, associate professor of psychiatry and director of the Neuro-X Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. “This bundle projects from your brain to every organ in your body, like your heart, your lungs, your spleen, your kidneys, your intestines. “The vagus nerve is this bidirectional superhighway that relays information from your brain to your body.” Nick soon enrolled as a participant in a VNS trial led by Dr. Charles Conwayand had a VNS device implanted. Related articleA ketamine pill may help hard-to-treat depression with fewer side effects, early research suggests “It’s a very small pulse generator that’s similar to a cardiac pacemaker,” said Conway, professor of psychiatry and director of the Center for the Advancement of Research in Resistant Mood and Affective Disorders at Washington University in St. Louis. The device is implanted underneath the collarbone, and a lead from the device is tunneled to the neck region, where it attaches to and stimulates the vagus nerve that, in turn, sends regular pulses to areas of the brain associated with mood regulation. The standard firing rate is 30 seconds every five minutes. Nick remains on VNS treatment to this day in addition to being on two antidepressants he alternates using with his doctor’s instructions, depending on which one s working for him. “It completely changed my life. I find joy every single day,” he said. “If it was just only medication, I don’t know that he would be alive today,” Mary said. “I tell Dr. Conway all the time, this was a miracle for us. Not to say that you don’t also have to dosome behavior modifications, and you have to learn coping techniques and all that. It isn’t this magic bullet. It’s work, (but) it has saved our lives together, and his life.” Despite the FDA’s approval of VNS treatment for treatment-resistant depression, in 2007, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services declined to insure the therapy, citing its conclusions that evidence was insufficient and that VNS was “not reasonable and necessary” for the condition. The CMS decision also had an impact on private insurance companies, many of which aligned themselves with the agency’s stance, Conway said. Subsequent studies provided additional support for VNS, prompting theCMS to decide in 2019to issue “coverage with evidence development.” This move made VNS accessible to people participating in a trial designed by the FDA-approved VNS device manufacturer, LivaNova, and approved by CMS. The results of that randomized clinical trial, conducted at 84 sites in the United States from September 2019 to May 2024, are now presented intwo studies published Wednesdayin the journal Brain Stimulation. LivaNova sponsored and funded the studies in partnership with CMS. The yearlong trial of 493 adults with an average age of 53 mirrors Nick’s experience — it found VNS therapy led to improvement in participants’ depressive symptoms, ability to complete daily tasksand quality of life. The population studied “was probably the sickest group of treatment-resistant depression patients ever studied,” said Conway, who was also lead investigator of the latest trial. “They had an average of 13 failed treatments, and the mean number of years that they had spent in depression was 29 years.” About 75% of these participants had been so ill they were unable to work, and 40% had previously attempted suicide at least once. “What’s really important here is that the patients themselves were reporting that their lives were improving,” Conway said in a news release. “And the nice thing about vagus nerve stimulation, we know from other studies, is that when the patient responds, the effects usually stick.” At the study’s outset, all participants were implanted with vagal nerve stimulators. After two weeks of recovery from surgery, half the participants had their devices turned on, while the stimulators in the other half, essentially a control group, were left off. Regardless of which group they were in, all participants remained on whatever treatment they had already been on, including drugs, therapy or both. “Then we gave them two months to, what we call, titrate up their current,” Conway said. “A certain amount of current is optimal for getting an antidepressant response.” Over the next 10 months, the adults participated in monthly evaluations of their depression symptoms, quality of life and other functional outcomes. The trial didn’t meet its primary goal, which was for the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, or MADRAS, to show more improvement in the active VNS group than in the inactive VNS group. But in judging the results in both groups according to this scale, there were no differences between the two. The MADRAS scale is one of the gold standard scales for evaluating individual symptoms that combine into depression, said Badran, who wasn’t involved in the study. It includes factors such as mood, sleep, appetite and energy level. Related articleA simple tool may be able to predict your risk for both dementia and depression, study finds “They allow for a more nuanced assessment of depression severity because it’s administered by a clinician,” Badran said. “It’s kind of a bummer to see that the primary endpoint failed to meet that significance.” The study, however, met its secondary goals — which included improvements in depressive symptoms, daily function and quality of life, according to three other rating scales reported by on-site clinicians, patients and offsite raters who weren’t privy to which participants’ devices had been activated. Overall, 18% of active VNS patients experienced symptom improvement by at least 50%, Conway said, which is considered a full response to treatment. Regarding quality of life, 53% of the active treatment group experienced progress. The tendency of clinical trials to meet only secondary outcomes isn’t uncommon, Badran said. “Not all studies have to hit on their primary (goal) to demonstrate some sort of efficacy,” he added. Most of the benefits were observed in the final three months of the 10-month treatment period, which wasn’t surprising or concerning since VNS treatment works cumulatively, experts said. What was surprising was that 16% of those in the inactive VNS group also reported antidepressant effects in the last few months, whereas the researchers had expected only around 10% of these participants to do so. “Participants may have been positively anticipating device activation at the 1-year time point, or ‘placebo’ effects were accentuated by foreknowledge of the trial duration and awareness that benefits typically accrue with VNS only after several months of treatment,” according to the study. The inactive group’s devices were turned on at the end of the trial so they, too, could hopefully benefit. With treatment-resistant depressionaffecting about 30%of an estimated21 million adultswith major depressive disorder, the findings are “really promising,” Badran said. Related articleA study identified 6 types of depression. Here’s why that matters The new research also carries substantially more significance than previous studies due to its large-scale recruitment and long-term follow-up, said Dr. Takuya Sasaki, professor of life and pharmaceutical sciences at Tohoku University in Japan, via email. Sasaki wasn’t involved in the study. The research “provides a sham-controlled, blinded comparison of how well VNS works for (treatment-resistant depression) in a rigorous study design,” said Dr. Sarah Lisanby, director of the Noninvasive Neuromodulation Unit of the Division of Intramural Research Program at the US National Institute of Mental Health, via email. Lisanby also wasn’t part of the research team. That the study’s primary endpoint wasn’t met and only up to 53% of the active VNS participants experienced improvements may be due to a few factors. The severity of depression in this trial “likely limited the possibility of response and remission in both groups,” the authors said. “To our knowledge, the degree of resistance in this trial exceeds any previous large, prospective, antidepressant therapeutic trial.” Additionally, having hundreds of patients in a clinical trial can also mean they’re not the most uniform in terms of their illness case, Badran said. Some people may not respond at all, while others fare quite well. On a positive note, the extent of resistance may also imply that patients with less resistance could benefit from VNS more, the authors added. Vagal nerve stimulation implants can sometimes cause side effects, such as shortness of breath, site irritation or vocal hoarseness when the device is on, experts said. Knowledge of all the ways by which VNS improves depression is still evolving, but the therapy likely works through multiple pathways, experts said. “If we look at VNS as a modulator of the central nervous system in the brain, there’s evidence to suggest that when you turn VNS on, you’re influencing thedefault mode network,” Badran said. “This network is involved in emotion, mood and self-processing.” Our fight-or-flight response is mediated by the vagus nerve, which releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine onto agitated organs to slow them down, Badran said. Vagus nerve stimulation can also increase the release of important brain chemicals such as serotonin and norepinephrine, which help regulate mood and are typically low in people with depression, Sasaki said. Related articleThese simple activities can treat depression as effectively as therapy, study says “The vagus nerve also helps control inflammation in the body,” higher levels of which have been linked to depression, Sasaki added. The treatment may help the brain become more adaptable and resilient by promoting the formation of new brain connections as well. The trial participants continue to be monitored, and data on their ongoing results may become available over the coming years. Conway plans to continue discussions with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services based on the trial results in hopes the findings will eventually help people with treatment-resistant depression and federal health insurance to be able to receive VNS therapy, he said. Accessibility of VNS treatment is still limited due to the roughly $25,000 price tag and the lack of coverage by federal insurance and by many private insurers, experts said. If you’re interested in trying VNS, you can inquire about private insurance coverage by calling your insurer or talking to your employer, which is what Mary did when Nick needed a device replacement due to a complication. If you’d like to participate in a clinical trial, talk to your doctor or psychiatrist to see if that’s an option for you, said Dr. Nils Kroemer, a professor of medical psychology at the University of Bonn in Germany, via email. Kroemer wasn’t involved in the study. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the size of the vagus nerve.",Health
Want to boost your immune system during the holidays? Make these 3 things habits,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/health/holiday-health-wellness/,"The holiday season can be intense. People are traveling, hosting family and friends, and going to events — all the while keeping up other responsibilities of work and caregiving. All this activity has me thinking about the importance of keeping our immune systems healthy. What are some habits that everyone should adopt, such as getting good sleep, eating well and exercising regularly? Conversely, are there some habits people should consider stopping because of their negative impacts on the immune system? Related articleWhat to know about the vaccines available this respiratory virus season What about vaccines — is it too late to get vaccinated against respiratory viruses if you are going to family gatherings with newborns or older adults? And are there other safety tips people should keep in mind to reduce their chances of getting sick during the holidays? To help sort through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN:Why it is especially important to keep our immune system healthy? Dr.Leana Wen:Our immune systems are our body’s natural defense against viruses, bacteria and other potential pathogens. Strong, healthy immune systems reduce the risk of contracting infectious diseases and falling seriously ill from them. The immune system is also implicated in some chronic diseases. Immunity is influenced by many factors, some of which are within our control. Getting recommended vaccines, for example, helps to build immunity against certain diseases. Beyond vaccines, there are several lifestyle factors that research shows also boost our body’s immune function. Related articleThey’re up to 70% of the American diet. But the US has no policy on ultraprocessed foods CNN: What habits should people adopt if they want to boost their immune function? Wen:There are three important habits that people should consider. First, keep physically active. In addition to reducing your chance of developing chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease, exercise stimulates the immune system. Being physically active may lower your chance of dying from the flu or pneumonia, according to theUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Second, cut down on ultraprocessed foods. These “junk foods” contain high amounts of chemicals like preservatives, emulsifiers, artificial colorings and dyes. Eating higher amounts of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespanby more than 10%. These foods have also been linked withinflammation and dysregulation. Lack of physical activity and higher consumption of ultraprocessed food are both associated with obesity, which islinkedto impaired immune function. People should aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate to high-intensity exercise and should try to have a diet that emphasizeswhole foodssuch as vegetables, lean meats, beans, whole grains and nuts. Related articleStudy expands the science on the link between sleep and dementia Third, aim for better sleep. Studies have shown thatsleep deprivationinduces immune changes that increase the risk of various diseases. And people who routinely getfewer than seven hoursof sleep a night have a higher likelihood of developing high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. There are several methods that can help with improved sleep. Many people struggle because they simply don’t have enough time in bed.Try to prioritizeat least eight hours in bed and aim to go to bed and to rise around the same time every day. Other elements of good sleep hygiene include not using screens before sleep and optimizing your sleep environment with a cool, quiet and dark place. Related articleWhy you should keep exercising in cold weather CNN: Are there habits that people should consider stopping to improve their immune systems? Wen:Yes. The most important are to avoid smoking and excessive alcohol. Many studieshave linked smoking to both short- andlong-termeffects on immunity, including impairing the body’s ability to fight viral and bacterial infections. Some of these effects are reversed by smoking cessation.Excessive alcohol intakecan also weaken immune system response. Individuals who wish to quit smoking can speak with a physician about options. There are medications that can help in addition to nicotine replacement therapies. The holidays may be a tough time to cut back on alcohol consumption, but people should try toavoid binge drinkingand to keep withinguidelines of drinking in moderation(two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women on days when alcohol is consumed). Related articleAlcohol is not good for us. 5 tips to stay safe(r) if you drink CNN: Is it too late to get vaccinated against respiratory viruses if you are going to family gatherings with newborns or older adults? Wen:It can take a couple of weeks for the body to build up antibody responses after vaccination. In general, it’s definitely a good idea to be sure you are up to date with your recommended vaccines and to be sure to get your annual flu and Covid-19 vaccines. If you are getting together in, say, a few days from now with vulnerable loved ones, obtaining the shots now probably won’t change your protection during this visit, but it’s still a good idea to get them since it will certainly help you throughout the respiratory virus season. Related articleIt’s time to get flu and Covid-19 shots CNN: What should vulnerable people do to reduce their risk of getting sick during the holidays? Wen:They should try to avoid crowded settings with many people shouting and speaking loudly. They should consider masking with an N95 or equivalent mask while traveling and in crowded public places. If they are at especially high risk, they could ask that people visiting them take extra precautions as well. These individuals can also reduce their time spent in crowded settings in the days leading up to a family gathering. And it’s still a good idea to take a rapid Covid-19 test just before seeing especially vulnerable loved ones.

What’s the best treatment for ADHD? Large new study offers clues,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/health/adhd-adult-treatments-study-wellness/,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, was long thought to be a disorder that only affected children. But now it’s well established that the symptoms can persist into adulthood — and a large new study has assessed which treatments may be most effective at alleviating them. Stimulant medications, and atomoxetine (a type of antidepressant), were more effective thanplacebosat reducing core ADHD symptoms during a 12-week period, found the study published Tuesday in the journalLancet Psychiatry. Core symptoms of the neurodevelopmental disorder are inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, said study author Dr. Samuele Cortese, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Southampton in England, in a Tuesday press briefing hosted by the Science Media Centre. Prior to conducting this study, Cortese and several other study authors had various types of affiliations — such as for consulting or research — with pharmaceutical companies, some of which manufacture ADHD medications. But the affiliations had no bearing on any aspect of the research, according to the study. Related articleAcetaminophen use in pregnancy not linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, large study finds Cortese said about 5% to 7% of children and 2.5% of adults worldwide have ADHD, which stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child. Those skills help people plan, focus attention, remember instructions, multitask and more. The symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity mean people with ADHD may have trouble staying organized, concentrating, managing time or controlling impulses, which can affect all areas of life. A health care provider determines a diagnosis by assessing whether symptoms are persistent, pervasive and inappropriate according to one’s developmental stage, and whether they interfere with a patient’s daily life. The disorder can also be associated with various additional challenges, such as mental or physical conditions, social problems and ahigher risk of premature death. “It’s a serious condition. It’s not a trivial one,” Cortese, also chair of the European ADHD Guidelines Group, said. “If you look atthe current guidelineson the management of ADHD in the UK,” Cortese said, “they recommend medication as the first line. They also mention non-pharmacological treatment if medication is not effective or not well tolerated, but they don’t specify which kind of non-pharmacological treatment. They also mention the possible combination.” There are still uncertainties about the best treatment for adults with ADHD, Cortese said — so he and the other authors aimed “to provide an updated synthesis of all the evidence available from trials on the pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions.” The research was done in association with people with lived experience of ADHD, the authors said. The study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 113 published and unpublished randomized controlled trials that compared various types of interventions against placebos or other controls for the symptoms of, in total, nearly 14,900 adult participants formally diagnosed with ADHD. Related articleTreating ADHD patients with medication linked to lower risk of death overall, study finds In a short-term period of 12 weeks, in ratings of symptom improvement by both clinicians and patients, only stimulants, such as lisdexamfetamine and methylphenidate, and atomoxetine yielded better results than a placebo. When it came to the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatments versus a placebo, there was a mismatch between clinicians’ opinions versus those of the patients themselves.Cognitive behavioral therapy,cognitive remediation, mindfulness,psychoeducationand transcranial direct current stimulation were also more effective than a placebo at reducing patients’ symptoms, but this outcome was reported by clinicians only. Transcranial direct current stimulationis a noninvasive, painless brain stimulation technique that uses low-intensity electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain. READ MORE:Social anxiety: How cognitive behavioral therapy can help The authors found several other outcomes, including that medications were more likely than placebos to be discontinued due to adverse events. For emotional dysregulation, which Cortese said many people with ADHD experience, atomoxetine and stimulants were more helpful than a placebo. But for executive function and quality of life, none of the treatments performed differently than a placebo. “There are several take home points from this study, which used a very clever approach to pool and contrast different types of ADHD treatments,” said Dr. Philip Shaw, professor in the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King’s College London, in a statement to the Science Media Centre. “First, the study shows that there are effective interventions for adults living with ADHD who are looking for ways to reduce any unwanted impact from symptoms,” said Shaw, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The downside was that some medications had troublesome side effects, though this wasn’t the case for psychostimulants, which are the most widely used medication.” The study also highlights “big gaps in our knowledge,” he said. The limitations of the study are due to shortcomings in the literature analyzed for the review, as well as the lack of research on some factors, said clinical psychologist Dr. Margaret Sibley, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Sibley wasn’t involved in the study. Related articleWhat it’s like to work with ADHD Since most of the treatment trials included in the review lasted less than three months, it’s hard to be sure about how long the benefits may last, Shaw said. The authors also looked at outcomes at 26 and 52 weeks, but these were limited due to an insufficient amount of data, said study author Dr. Edoardo G. Ostinelli, senior researcher and deputy lead at the University of Oxford’s Oxford Precision Psychiatry Lab, in the Science Media Centre briefing. However, “non-pharmacological treatments like (cognitive behavioral therapy) are not designed to reduce core symptoms of ADHD, although they sometimes do indirectly,” Sibley said via email. “They are designed to teach coping skills to reduce the impact of symptoms on one’s life. So if the primary outcome in this review had been impairment or ADHD coping skills, or psychological variables like self-worth or self-efficacy or sense of autonomy — you might have seen different findings.” READ MORE:The benefits of ‘body doubling’ when you have ADHD, according to experts It’s also likely that differences in effectiveness of treatments simply boil down to the fact that one size doesn’t fit all, Ostinelli said. Some people with ADHD are apprehensive about taking medication or have experienced side effects they are uncomfortable with, said Dr. Alessio Bellato, a lecturer in child and adolescent mental health at the University of Southampton who wasn’t involved in the study. “The review also points out a continual challenge when conducting ADHD research with adults,” Sibley added. “Self-perception of ADHD symptoms is fallible in all people. They are somewhat subjective symptoms. However, there are no ‘objective’ tests that can accurately measure ADHD symptoms. Best practice is actually to use informant reports (i.e., reports of loved ones) in combination with self-report when assessing adult ADHD.” These reports are sometimes integrated with clinician reports to make a final determination of whether a symptom is present, but most treatment studies don’t use this strategy, which can lead to unclear findings in research studies, she added. Related articleThe holidays can be stressful and anxiety-inducing. Here’s how to make them fun and exciting again All considered, because people with ADHD usually seek treatment with the hope of improving more than just core symptoms, best practice in adult ADHD treatment typically includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological care, Sibley said — a combination the study did not have data for, but one that can “help people take control of their ADHD and learn to write their own owner’s manual as they craft a life that works for them.” The study reflects the need for more long-term studies on various types of treatments and combinations of them, especially among adults, experts said.",Health
Two US Navy pilots eject safely over Red Sea after fighter jet shot down in apparent friendly fire incident,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/politics/us-fighter-jet-shot-down-red-sea/,"Two US Navy pilots ejected safely after their fighter jet was shot down over the Red Sea on Saturday in an apparent friendly fire incident, US Central Command said in a statement. The pilots were recovered, and one of the crew members sustained minor injuries, according to initial assessments. The aircraft, an F/A-18, was operating from the USS Harry S. Truman when it was “mistakenly fired” upon by the USS Gettysburg, CENTCOM said. The USS Gettysburg, a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser, is part of the Truman carrier strike group, which entered the waters of the Middle East one week ago. A full investigation is underway. CENTCOM stressed the incident was not the result of hostile fire. The Iran-backed Houthi militant group in Yemen has repeatedly made false claims of striking US warships operating in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The US has maintained a near-constant presence of major Navy warships in the region since the start of the war in Gaza, as the Houthis havetargeted ships in the Red Sea, one of theworld’s busiest waterways, calling the attacks a response to Israel’s war against Hamas. The apparent friendly fire incident comes the same day the US carried out airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility in the capital of Sana’a. The US also shot down one-way attack drones and an anti-ship cruise missile, according to CENTCOM. The strikes on the Iran-backed rebel group involved the use of Navy F/A-18 fighter jets, as well as US Air Force assets, CENTCOM said. According to two US military officials, the downed fighter jet was not part of the strikes in Yemen. The Houthis, who control Yemen’s most populous regions, say they won’t stop striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. The F/A-18 incident also came the same day Houthi forces in Yemen saidthey fired a hypersonic ballistic missileat an Israeli military target in Tel Aviv’s Jaffa area. The missile fired from Yemen hit Tel Aviv overnight into Saturday, Israeli authorities said, in a rare instance of a failed interception over the city. More than a dozen people sustained minor injuries, according to emergency services, but no fatalities were reported.

Trump confronts the limitations of his electoral mandate,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/politics/trump-mandate-washington-challenges/,"Donald Trumphas yet to arrive in Washington, but he is already confronting the limitations of his electoral mandate. Trump’s eleventh-hour attempt to blow upa carefully negotiated billto keep the government funded into March did not achieve the outcome he had sought: clearing adebt ceiling battlelooming early in his next presidency. It did, however, expose alingering riftamong House Republicans that had been hiding behind the GOP’s post-election euphoria and made clear Trump’s sway over his own party remains far from absolute. In a stunning turn, 38 Republicans defied the president-elect on Thursday. By early Saturday morning — 48 hours after Trump threatened primary challenges for anyone who supported funding the government without eliminating the debt limit — 170 House Republicans and dozens of GOP senatorsvoted for just that. Related articleBiden signs stopgap funding bill into law after Congress votes to avert shutdown The chaotic episode one month before Trump returns to the White House served as a reminder that governing has foiled plenty of successful politicians, and it foreshadowed the challenges ahead for Trump as he navigates a narrow House majority and a Senate full of people who expect to outlast the president-elect’s four years in Washington. Trump has asserted his decisive November victory should clear any roadblocks standing in the way of his agenda. He has demanded fealty from fellow Republicans while often overstating the breadth of his win. Though he is the first Republican in a generation to win the popular vote, Trump ended up with less than 50% of the country behind him and his Electoral College margin was sizable but hardly historic. “The beauty is that we won by so much,” Trump toldTime Magazinein a recentinterview. “The mandate was massive.” Yet, Trump in the last month has already faced several high-profile defeats at the hands of his own party before even taking office. The president-elect appeared this week to punt on an effort to get his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a US Senate seat in the face of quiet but unwavering opposition from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In the weeks after President-elect Trump tapped Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state, DeSantis had faced intense public pressure to appoint her as a replacement, with Elon Musk (and his mother) and other MAGA-aligned Republicans publicly lobbying for her. Multiple sources with knowledge of their recent interactions told CNN the president-elect had made his preference known to DeSantis through private back channels. DeSantis relayed back to Trump a delicate message: He had nothing against Lara Trump, but he felt the optics of appointing her to such a high-profile post were problematic and he was looking elsewhere to fill the seat. On Monday, thepresident-elect told reportershe didn’t expect DeSantis to name Lara to the post and distanced himself from the campaign pushing his daughter-in-law all together. “Ron is doing a good job,” Donald Trump said. “That’s his choice, nothing to do with me.” And on Saturday, Lara Trump publicly withdrew from consideration for the potential vacancy,posting on X, “After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate.” Related articleHere’s what’s in and out of the government funding agreement President-elect Trump previouslyabandoned his first choiceto serve as his attorney general, former Rep.

Trump had long considered his pick to lead the Justice Department the most critical post in his Cabinet and now has settled for a fallback, former Florida Attorney GeneralPam Bondi. One of Trump’s top allies in the Senate, Florida’s Rick Scott, overwhelmingly lost his bid to lead the incoming Republican majority toSen. John Thune, who had previously encouraged his party to move on from the former president. While Trump didn’t formally endorse in the race, Scott was publicly backed by many of the president-elect’s top allies, including Charlie Kirk, the founder of the pro-Trump group Turning Point USA, and billionaire Musk. Despite these setbacks, Trump has managed to assert himself as the predominant figure in his party ahead of his return to Washington. While the Gaetz nomination faltered, Trump has marched ahead with a series ofunconventional Cabinet picksthat continue to test Republican senators. Trump has stood by former Fox anchor Pete Hegseth, his pick for secretary of defense, amid acascade of damaging revelations, including asexual assault allegation; concerns about his tenureleading a veterans charity; questions about past alcoholic consumption habits; and anunearthed email from his mothercalling him “an abuser of women.” Hegseth’s mother retracted her remark during an appearance on Fox News, and Hegseth has denied many of the allegations raised against him. Republican support for Hegseth on Capitol Hill appears to have stabilized amid Trump’s insistence, andsenators so far remain opento Trump’s other controversial choices to lead his government, including anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health and human services and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence. Trump’s allies have demanded unquestioned loyalty from Republican lawmakers and have publicly threatened those who may consider defying the incoming president on any front. “For every US senator out there, you must confirm Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Kash Patel, Bobby Kennedy, Pam Bondi and Trump’s entire Cabinet, or you will face a primary challenger immediately,” Kirk warned at a Turning Point USA event Friday in Arizona. By Friday evening, Trump’s allies — particularlyhis co-agitator, Musk— had spun their derailing of the government funding vote as a victory. Musk, who posted dozens of times about the vote on his social media website, X, in recent days, shared a picture of the 1,500-page bill they helped kill next to a smaller stack depicting the bill that ultimately passed. “Your actions turned a bill that weighed pounds into a bill that weighed ounces!” Musk wrote triumphantly. Still, there are clearly frustrations building among Republicans that Trump has expended so much of his political capital (and their time) on quixotic causes before he is sworn in to office. Some publicly grumbled that Trump and Musk had not actually won any spending cuts in the smaller bill House Speaker Mike Johnsonpushed through Fridaywith the help of Democratic votes. Others found their tactics to be confounding. “I will eat sh*t sandwiches — which is budget bills and debt ceiling increases — so that Trump has a great runway,” Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw said Friday, “but you’ve got to plan ahead to do that.” Related articleHow CEOs are trying to be like Musk and curry favor with Trump Just before the House voted Friday night, Trump lamented to one GOP lawmaker in a call that the spending deal couldn’t include a hike in the debt ceiling, an issue that he knows now he will have to confront in his presidency. The debt limit is set to return in January, but lawmakers likely would have until mid-2025 to address the ceiling. The source familiar with the call told CNN that Trump seemed frustrated yet resigned as reality began setting in that despite his massive influence over the GOP, there are some issues that some conservatives will not bend on for him. Lawmakers on Friday finally convinced Trump he couldn’t achieve his goal without a costly shutdown. Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota told reporters that he wasn’t surprised the debt limit — a legal cap on how much the federal government can borrow that takes an act of Congress to lift — wasn’t addressed in the short-term funding package. “That’s a pretty valuable commodity for the Democrats to give up. And so I’m sure they’ll want a pound of flesh someplace to address that — it has to be expected they’ll try it,” he said. Trump allies, though, are signaling this is only the beginning. “If you think the last 48 hours have been unique,” former Trump adviser Steve Bannon said Friday on his podcast, “every day coming in when President Trump takes over is going to be like this.” This story has been updated with new developments.

Democrat’s report is arguably most comprehensive yet detailing Justices Thomas and Alito’s property deals,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/politics/durbin-report-thomas-alito-disclosure-laws-supreme-court/,"A top Senate Democrat on Saturday accused conservative Supreme Court justices ofviolating federal disclosure lawsin a lengthy report that caps a monthslong investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee and comes weeks before Republicans take control of the chamber. The report from aides to Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and chairman of the committee, says that the failure by conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito to disclose lavish trips and other gifts from wealthy businessmen “constitutes a violation of federal law.” Related articleSupreme Court agrees to hear case over TikTok ban Durbin’s report is arguably the most comprehensive yet detailing luxury travel, private jet flights and property deals arranged for some of the justices, though it mainly calls attention to trips and gifts that have been publicly known for months. The report appears designed to lay out a record of questionable ethics on the court as Democrats prepare to hand over power to the GOP. “Now more than ever before, as a result of information gathered by subpoenas, we know the extent to which the Supreme Court is mired in an ethical crisis of its own making,” Durbin said in a statement. “It’s clear that the justices are losing the trust of the American people at the hands of a gaggle of fawning billionaires.” A Supreme Court spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Similar allegations have been raised previously – including by Durbin – and the policymaking arm of the federal judiciary has been looking into claims that Thomas’ actions violated disclosure law for more than a year. Both Thomas and Alito have cited the “personal hospitality” exemption from annual reporting requirements, which they said relieved them of any obligation to report the trips. The federal judiciary clarified last year that the rules require jurists to disclose non-business stays at resorts and the use of private jets. In response to the outcry over the Thomas trips, the Supreme Court adopted itsfirst-ever code of conduct a year ago, but the document quickly faced criticism because it includes no enforcement mechanism. Durbin’s report also recounts a scandal this year involving two controversial flags – including an upside-down US flag – hoisted over properties that Alito owns. And it asserted Thomas “violated the law on multiple occasions” by not recusing in cases involving the 2020 presidential election, despite political advocacy by his wife, Ginni Thomas, in support of then-President Donald Trump. Federal law gives justices wide latitude to make their own recusal decisions. It requires them to bow out when a spouse has an “interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome” of a case. Republicans, including Trump, have defended Thomas and Alito and have accused Democrats of trying to delegitimize the court’s conservative majority by focusing on ethics.With Republicans capturing control of the Senate and the White House, ethics proposals that Durbin and other Senate Democrats have supported in recent months are certain to be shelved. “The Majority Staff Report is not merely the Thomas Report, though he plays the most prominent role,” said Gabe Roth, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Fix the Court, in a statement. “It shows how nearly every justice — liberal and conservative, both those who’ve left the Court in the recent past and the nine who serve today — has made lapses in judgment when it comes to their ethical responsibilities.” This story has been updated with new reporting.",Politics
Trump wants to scrap Biden’s ban on a chunk of natural gas exports. It won’t help America’s top buyer much,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/business/trump-liquefied-natural-gas-ban-overturn-europe-intl/,"President-elect Donald Trump is setto overturn a ban on some US exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, in a boon for US energy producers. But the move is unlikely to help address the climate crisis and may even make it worse. As for the biggest buyer of American LNG — Europe — which depends heavily on natural gas imports, it will have to wait till after the end of the decade to see the benefit. The region would welcome extra flows from January as, after nearly three bruising years of high energy prices, it is on the brink of losing one of its last remaining sources of Russian pipeline gas. “The global gas market remains on edge heading into winter, unassuaged by warm winter weather predictions,” Bank of America strategists wrote in a note this month. “The market remains vulnerable due to relatively low inventories in Europe, the historical inaccuracy of weather forecasts, uncertainty around gas supplies from Russia and the startup timelines for new LNG projects.” LNG is a chilled, liquid form of naturalgas that can be transported via sea tankers — and American exports are booming. In less than a decade, the United States has gone from selling negligible amounts of the fuel abroad toleapfroggingAustralia and Qatar to become theworld’s top supplier, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Related articleBiden administration to pause proposed natural gas export projects Yet, in January, the Biden administration paused federal authorizations for several pending LNG export projects while it assessed the impact of the export boom on the environment and on energy security and prices at home. The pause does not apply to exports that had already been approved. On Tuesday, the Department of Energy published thatassessment, forecasting that, if the US increases LNG exports beyond what’s currently authorized, theresulting emissionswould amount to an additional 1.5 gigatons of planet-warming pollution or so per year by 2050, equivalent to a quarter of current US annual greenhouse gas emissions. The final decision on additional LNG exports is “in the hands of the next administration,” Energy Sec. Jennifer Granholm told reporters. Some studies have found that LNG produces significantly less greenhouse gas pollution over its lifecycle than other fossil fuels, but itsclimate impactwill depend on whether the gas is displacing oil and coal or, rather, clean renewable energy. Other studies have detected high rates ofleakage of methane— the main component of LNG — at various points during the fuel’s production. Methane is a potent planet-heating gas, with 80 times more warming power over short timeframes than carbon dioxide. Trump’s allies are already making plans to lift the LNG moratorium after he takes office in January, according to a source familiar with discussions among the incoming president’s advisers as well as candidates under consideration for national security roles. Here is what this means for America’s biggest customer. Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia was the European Union’sbiggest supplierof natural gas. Since then, the bloc whittled Moscow’s share of its imports down to 15% in 2023 from 45% in 2021 by slashing the supply arriving via pipeline. To fill the gap, Europe has importedvast quantitiesof LNG from the US and other countries, as well as pipeline gas from Norway. Now, according to the EIA — which counts the United Kingdom and Turkey as part of Europe — the region is the biggest recipient of USLNG exports, soaking up two-thirds of the shipments last year. The EU has also ramped up imports of Russian LNG to help heat its homes and power its factories. But the bloc faces a self-imposed deadline of 2027 to break its dependence on all fossil fuel imports from Moscow, setting the US up to play an even bigger role as the region’s energy supplier. That independence day is still far off, however. Well before then, on January 1, 2025, a contract enabling the transit of Russian pipeline gas through Ukraine isset to expire. The flows represent about 5% of the EU’s total gas imports, according to Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, and supply mainly Austria, Hungary and Slovakia. These countries are not at risk of an energy shortage, say analysts, noting they would likely fill the gap by importing more LNG or more natural gas via pipeline from other European nations. But the loss of the flows via Ukraine will make it harder for Europe to refill its stores before next winter, said Massimo Di Odoardo, a senior natural gas researcher at energy data firm Wood Mackenzie. The global LNG supply is expected to grow only modestly over 2025, he told CNN, such that “Europe will struggle to get storage levels up to a very comfortable level at the end of next summer.” Natural gas prices in Europe have tumbled from all-time highs reached in summer 2022 but are still more than double their historical levels. The end of the transit deal is one reason prices are unlikely to decline much next year, analysts told CNN. Di Odoardo said prices are likely to remain close to their current levels or perhaps rise if the contract is not renewed. The picture should brighten for Europe in the second half of the decade, when a wave of fresh LNG supply from the US, Qatar and other producers is expected to hit the global market. By the end of the decade, the amount of LNG trading in the world market is likely to be 50% higher than currently, excluding the potential supply from the currently pending US projects﻿, according to Di O﻿doardo. Any additional flows due to the reversal of Biden’s ban would not enter the market until after 2030, analysts said. When they do, they will contribute to broader downward pressure on European natural gas prices. In a note earlier this month, analysts at Capital Economics said their central forecast is for European prices to roughly halve from current levels by the end of 2026. Related articleEurope’s biggest economy is in crisis. Just look at Volkswagen Even so, prices are unlikely to return to their levels before Europe’s energy crisis, according to Francisco Blanch, head of commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America. Natural gas prices soared in the wake of Russia’s invasion, which followed a rise in global demand for energy as economies reopened after Covid lockdowns. As long as Europe continues to import LNG across huge distances — crossing the Atlantic Ocean, for example — and not from an immediate neighbor, Blanch told CNN, it will bear the costs of transportation and other logistics. It’s a predicament that puts Europeanbusinesses at a competitive disadvantage to those in the US, which generally pay much less for their energy. European natural gas prices are currently up to five times higher than those in the US, according to analysts at Capital Economics, who expect the gap to narrow by the end of 2026 — resulting in prices that are up to three times higher. Writing in landmarkreportin September, Mario Draghi, the former chief of the European Central Bank, said that volatility in European energy prices is “also a significant factor, hampering energy-intensive industries and the entire economy.” Likewise, Blanch at Bank of America makes a striking observation. “(Companies) have been moving their operations away (from Europe),” he said. “If you have a heavy or chemical industry — which is a high-energy-intensity industry — you’re going to the US Gulf Coast. You’re going to the source of the energy.” Laura Paddison contributed reporting.","Politics, Business"
New York governor orders firing of prison staffers involved in inmate’s fatal beating,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/us/robert-brooks-fatal-beating-prison-staffers-firing/,"New York’s governor has ordered more than a dozen prison staffers to be fired over the fatal beating of an inmate earlier this month. Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Saturday that she has directed the state’s corrections department commissioner to begin the process of terminating 14 workers involved in the fatal attack at the Marcy Correctional Facility. Robert Brooks died on Dec. 10 after an encounter with officers the day earlier at the prison located in Oneida County. Hochul’s office didn’t elaborate on the circumstances leading up to the death but said her decision comes after an internal review. “The vast majority of correction officers do extraordinary work under difficult circumstances, and we are all grateful for their service,” the Democrat said in a statement. “But we have no tolerance for individuals who cross the line, break the law and engage in unnecessary violence or targeted abuse.” The corrections department on Saturday provided a list of 13 employees, including correctional officers, sergeants and a nurse, who have been suspended without pay as well as another correctional officer who has resigned. But the agency declined to provide more details about the incident other than to say that Brooks was pronounced dead at a hospital in Utica in the early morning hours on Dec. 10. The 43-year-old had been serving a 12-year prison sentence for first-degree assault since 2017, according to the department. State Department of Corrections Commissioner Daniel Martuscello III also denounced the staffers’ actions and said the suspensions are “in the best interest of the agency and the communities we serve.” “There is no place for brutality in our department and we will vigorously pursue justice against the individuals who committed this senseless act,” he said in an emailed statement. “These investigations are ongoing and additional suspensions may be issued.” The labor union representing correctional officers didn’t immediately comment. Brooks’ family said in a statement from their lawyer that they are “incredibly shocked and saddened” about the death, according toThe Times-Union in Albany, which first reported the death. “We are grateful that Gov. Hochul is taking swift action to hold officers accountable, but we cannot understand how this could have happened in the first place,” the family said in its statement, according to the newspaper. “No one should have to lose a family member this way.” State Attorney General Letitia James said her office is also investigating the use of force by correction officers that led to the death. The Democrat said her staff has obtained video of the incident and will make it public after Brooks’ family has viewed it. “Law enforcement professionals must be held to the highest standards of accountability, and I am committed to providing New Yorkers with the transparency they deserve,” James said in a statement.",Society
Top-ranking NYPD officer abruptly resigns amid sexual misconduct allegations,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/us/nypd-jeffrey-maddrey-resigns/,"The top uniformed police officer in the New York Police Department has resigned amid allegations he demanded sex from a subordinate in exchange for opportunities to earn extra pay. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted the resignation of Chief of DepartmentJeffrey MaddreyFriday night, effective immediately, according to an emailed statement from the department Saturday. John Chell, the department’s chief of patrol, will take over as interim chief of department and Philip Rivera will assume Chell’s duties as the head of the patrol division, the department said. The department declined to comment on the allegations against Maddrey other than to say it “takes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and will thoroughly investigate this matter.” A lawyer for his accuser, Lt. Quathisha Epps, said the move was overdue. “This should have been done a long time ago,” attorney Eric Sanders said by phone Saturday. “This has been years in the making, this kind of behavior. This is not shock for anyone who understands how things work in this department.” On Saturday, Eppsfiled a complaintagainst the city with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that Maddrey engaged in “quid pro quo sexual harassment” by coercing her to “perform unwanted sexual favors in exchange for overtime opportunities in the workplace.” Epps, who holds an administrative post in Maddrey’s office, said that when she finally pushed back at Maddrey’s demands, he retaliated by claiming she was abusing overtime, prompting the department to launch a review. Sanders said his client was then suspended without pay despite putting in her retirement notice earlier this week. Epps was the department’s top earner in fiscal year 2024, earning more than $400,000, according to local media reports — more than half of it in overtime pay. “Ms. Epps has endured profound harm at the hands of individuals who exploited their positions of power for personal gain,” Sanders said in a statement. “The retaliation she faced for standing up to this abuse underscores the need for immediate reforms to address systemic failures within the NYPD.” Spokespersons for the department declined to comment on the complaint, but Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office said it is investigating. “These are extremely serious and disturbing claims that allegedly occurred at N.Y.P.D. headquarters in Manhattan,” the office said in a statement. Mayor Eric Adams, a former police captain, said at an unrelated event Saturday that the allegations against Maddrey were “extremely concerning and alarming” and that the department was conducting a full review, the New York Post reported. Maddrey’s attorney, Lambros Lambrou, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the various allegations. However, in a statement to the New York Post, he dismissed Epps’ claims as “completely meritless.” “What a convenient time to accuse somebody of misconduct after she’s caught stealing time,” Lambrou told the paper. “She’s obviously drowning and in the deep end of the pool without a lifesaver. She wants to take down as many people as she can.” Sanders responded that any overtime his client worked was at the request of Maddrey and approved by him and other department officials. Meanwhile, Maddrey has been the subject of other misconduct allegations, including one from a police captain who says she rebuffed his unwanted advances for years. John Scola, a lawyer for Gabrielle Walls, said in a statement that Maddrey’s departure “vindicates” the police captain, who this week amended her sexual harassment lawsuit against another top officer to include Maddrey. Walls said in the filing that she dreaded interacting with Maddrey because he frequently tried to kiss her, prompting her to hide from him with the door locked and lights turned off. “We hope this high-profile resignation marks the beginning of a cultural shift to eliminate the pervasive environment of harassment and retaliation within the NYPD,” Scola said. A former officer has also claimed Maddrey coerced her into a yearslong affair while he was her supervisor, though that case was dismissed by a state judge last month, the New York Post and others reported. Earlier this year, an administrative trial judge in the department recommended dropping adisciplinary case against Maddreyregarding a November 2021 incident in which he ordered officers to void the arrest of a retired officer who previously worked for him. Maddrey joined the police force in 1991 at the age of 20 and rose through the ranks to become chief of patrol in 2021, before being promoted to chief of department last December, according to hisdepartment biography. The chief of department is charged with overseeing the department’s “crime-fighting strategies, quality of life initiatives, and operational plans,” according Tisch’s Saturday announcement. The chief of patrol manages the department’s largest bureau, which consists of 15,000 uniformed patrol officers and 3,000 civilians. “The NYPD works tirelessly to protect New Yorkers, and these roles are critical to keeping our communities safe,” Tisch said in her statement. “The interim Chiefs of Department and Patrol will continue to lead the efforts to reduce crime and disorder and build public trust.”",Society
Why the Wisconsin school shooting has thrust a European rock band back into the spotlight,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/us/kmfdm-band-wisconsin-school-shooting/,"Searing guitar riffs, primal drums, and electronic textures collide with impassioned vocals to createa chaotic yet precise sonic stormthat blurs the lines between human aggression and mechanical force. That’s industrial rock, and for fans of German band KMFDM, it is the sweet spot between the freedom to express individuality and rebelling against a system of political corruption and injustice. But in 1999, when the band’s lyrics were cited by the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, which resulted in 13 deaths, their message of resistance was suddenly eclipsed by the violence they had long condemned. In January, a song by the band was featured in aTikTok videoposted moments before a 17-year-old unleashed gunfire at Iowa’s Perry High School, killing two and wounding others. And now, the band has once again been thrust into the spotlight by photos of 15-year-old freshmanNatalie Rupnow, who on Monday killed a teacher and student at her private school in Madison, Wisconsin. The images show her wearing a black KMFDM band shirt while at a shooting range. KMFDM issued a statement condemning the Columbine massacre, expressing sympathy for the victims and explaining its music was intended to stand against violence. “KMFDM are an art form — not a political party. From the beginning our music has been a statement against war, oppression, fascism and violence against others,” read the statement at the time. KMFDM told CNN on Saturday it has been “distressing” to be in a similar situation again, after “how unfairly maligned KMFDM was by the media during Columbine, in what was tantamount to a witch hunt.” “We stand by these words as strongly now as we did back then,” KMFDM said in its statement. “We don’t believe Natalie Rupnow wore a KMFDM T-shirt because she’s necessarily a fan of the band, but instead because she glorified the Columbine shooters. Sadly, there’s a subculture of sick individuals who do have an obscure fascination with the Columbine massacre, and our band’s acronym will forever be associated with it.” KMFDM said the concern should not be its music but the ubiquitous culture of gun violence in the United States, with a persistent rise in gun-related deaths and mass shootings that have killed hundreds of children and school staff in classrooms. “In a culture that is obsessed with guns, people will always try and blame someone or something else for these tragic events, rather than the abundant and easy access to firearms,” KMFDM said. The first decade of industrial music was recognized as being “very experimental and very hard to listen to,” said industrial music expert Alexander Reed. It started with combining noise samples – ranging from vacuum cleaners, power tools or banging on metal – with drum beats and turning them into songs. “It was very interested in turning noise into music and music into noise. That’s tied into their idea of flipping notions of the powerless versus the empowered, or good versus evil,” Reed, a professor of music at Ithaca College, told CNN. Industrial music originated in the 1970s in northern England, Germany, and, to some extent, San Francisco before spreading all over the world. Around the mid-1980s, Reed says, industrial musicians began incorporating influences from dance music and rock ‘n’ roll, leading to KMFDM’s rise. The band was founded in 1984 as a performance art project. KMFDM is its original German name, which is intentionally grammatically absurd and stands for “Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid,” translated and interpreted as “No pity for the majority.” The name, KMFDM told CNN, was inspired by Dadaism, the early 20th centuryantiestablishment art movementwhich rejected nationalism and war. Related cardGun violence is remaking America’s classrooms KMFDM surged to success in the late ’80s and early’90s, alongside fellow industrial pioneers Nine Inch Nails and Ministry, who helped bring the genre into the mainstream. Themes of dominance and military violence come up all over the history of both industrial and electronic music. They are expressed through the melodic differences between electronic instruments and acoustic rock, Clara Latham, an assistant professor of music technology at The New School in New York City told CNN. Electronic instruments, like drum machines, synthesizers, and keyboards, have a machine precision that lacks the nuance that a drummer or guitar player conveys with fluctuations in tempo. When these elements collide, Latham says, they create a cacophony of melodic chaos. “The sound gets associated with a kind of oppressive quality in comparison, and that became part of the industrial aesthetic,” Latham said. “Compare a crazy guitar solo where the guitar sounds like it has a mind of its own, with an electronic artist at a console turning knobs – it has a totally different connotation.” The combination of the aesthetic sound differences projects the anti-violence messages behind the music: “There is a very, very clear anti-authority, anti-capitalism, anti-establishment political message that’s trying to be shouted,” Latham said. “One of the reasons why they have an enduring sort of legacy among young people is they really make people feel listened to,” Reed said. “They stand for the side of the oppressed, so their politics and their music seem to say, ‘Hey, if you are marginalized, if you are pushed to the side, we will listen to you.’ And some of that sort of earnest fist pumping power that comes through their rock influences is acting as a way to empower their listeners.” KMFDM has released 24 studio albums and related projects and continues to release music. The band had a 40th anniversary tour around the world in October. “KMFDM’s fans are incredibly dedicated, outspoken and loyal, without them, it would be unbearable to continue to exist through times like these,” KMFDM said. It is unclear if Rupnow was inspired by the Columbine shooters or if her interest in KMFDM stemmed from Columbine shooter Eric Harris wearing the band’s shirt and citing its lyrics. But whether an individual has a particular musical preference likely has no effect on their decisions to carry out violence, Indre Viskontas, neuroscientist and associate professor of psychology at the University of San Francisco, told CNN. “When people are in a state of anger or very heightened emotions, they often listen to music to help them regulate their emotions, to blow off steam, get that anger out in a healthy way, so that they don’t act aggressively, or ways in which they wouldn’t want to,” Viskontas said. “A person who is going to go into a school and murder children has a lot of issues. That is not healthy behavior, so there’s obviously a lot of failures that have led up to that particular behavior, but I don’t see any evidence that their particular style of music would lead to or enhance that behavior.” Related articleNearly 300,000 lives could be saved in the next decade if states followed California’s example on gun laws, study says Reed, who wrote the book “Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music,” points to examples of how people misinterpret music to fit their own ideas. “People are going to mishear things. Paul Ryan thought that Rage Against the Machine was a right-wing band, and they clapped back saying ‘You are the machine against whom we rage,’” Reed said. One alt-right founder and white nationalist “claimed Depeche Mode is the official band of the alt right when they had been wearing literal Karl Marx beards unironically in their previous video.” It may also be likely that the Columbine shooters misinterpreted the messages in KMFDM’s music, Reed said, since the band consistently denounces violence and uses lyrics that critique social and political issues. “KMFDM was one of a bunch of bands that they listened to and music was only one of a bunch of things that they were into, a lot of which was a lot less savory,” Reed said. “But the most important thing that Columbine kids were into were guns.” The past year has continued to see a rising number of school shootings anda lack of legislation to curb gun violence. There have been at least 83 school shootings in the US so far this year as of December 16, according to CNN’sanalysis of eventsreported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety. “After every school shooting, we outsource our conversations, difficult decisions, policies, and our sense of societal guilt to symbols, so we can point to them and say, ‘Oh, well, they listen to this rock band’ and we no longer have to have a conversation about gun control, or the degree to which we are raising our adolescents through screens and algorithms that veer their screens toward extremist politics,” Reed said. “We are missing the point – that the problem is not the music, it’s the guns.”","Society, World"
Questions mount in Germany over deadly Christmas attack as suspect appears in court,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/europe/german-market-attack-suspect-court-intl/,"Authorities in Germany face growing accusations they could have done more to prevent a deadly Christmas market attack as a judge ordered the suspect to be held in pre-trial detention following a late-night court appearance on Saturday. Taleb Al Abdulmohsen is accused of ramming a car into a busy market in the city of Magdeburg, killing five people and injuring more than 200. The motive for the attack is unclear but the suspect is a 50-year-old Saudi citizen who has lived in Germany for more than a decade and worked to help Saudis leave his home country. On social media, he has been a fervent critic of Islam and prosecutors suggested he may have become embittered with how Germany treats Saudi refugees. Recent messages grew increasingly threatening. One says, “if Germany wants to kill us, we will slaughter them, die, or go to prison with pride.” “The magistrate ordered pre-trial detention for five counts of murder, several counts of attempted murder and several counts of dangerous bodily harm,” astatement from police early Sundaysaid. “The accused was taken to a correctional facility accordingly.” Related articleWhat we know about the suspect behind the German Christmas market attack The police also released additional details on the victims of Friday’s attack. The dead include a nine-year-old boy and four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, according to the statement. On Sunday, the nine-year-old boy’s mother said her son “didn’t do anything to anybody,” in a Facebook post. “He was only nine years with us on earth… just why, I don’t understand.” The attack has been met with confusion and anger from the public and politicians, with questions raised over potential security lapses just two months before federal elections where immigration is likely to be a flashpoint issue. Germany stepped up security at Christmas markets - a fixture of the festive season - following a deadly car ramming in Berlin in 2016. But Magdeburg police chief Tom-Oliver Langhans said Saturday that the attacker was able to gain access to the market using emergency exit points, usually reserved for ambulances and other emergency vehicles. At the same conference, city official Ronni Krug insisted the security concept for the Magdeburg Christmas market was “constantly being revised and modified.” Krug continued, “How this case could come about must first be investigated by the police. I will not indulge in speculation. But you can rest assured that we will continue to update the security concept, which we are constantly updating anyway, once we have reached an assessment with our colleagues from the police.” Saudi authorities had previously warned their German counterparts about the suspected attacker, on several occasions, two sources with knowledge of the communications told CNN. CNN reached out to the German Foreign Ministry for comment about the warnings and was referred to the Ministry of Interior, which in turn referred CNN to the public prosecutor’s office in Magdeburg. CNN has not received a response from the prosecutor’s office. But speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF, Holger Münch, the president of Germany’s federal criminal office confirmed, “We ourselves were once the recipient of a tip-off from Saudi Arabia in November 2023.” He continued that proceedings were initiated and Saxony-Anhalt police took “appropriate investigative measures,” however the information they had on Taleb al-Abdulmohsen was too “unspecific” and he was “not known for violent acts.” German politicians from opposite ends of the political spectrum have seized on Friday’s deadly attack to attack the coalition government. Sahra Wagenknecht, leader of the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance party, called for Interior Minister Nancy Faeser to explain “why so many tips and warnings were ignored beforehand.” Bernd Baumann, the parliamentary head of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), demanded a special parliamentary session be called to discuss security issues in a post on X. In a signal of the tensions that have been stirred up in the wake of the attack, far-right protesters took to the streets of Magdeburg on Saturday evening. Some clad in balaclavas, they waved a sign saying “remigration” – a term calling for the mass deportation of immigrants. Saturday’s demonstration was attended by over 2,000 people, police said. The anti-immigrant AfD is holding a rally on Monday followed by a march mourning the victims. CNN’s Ivana Kottasová and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.",World
"Family killed in Israeli strike in northern Gaza, as aid reaches neighborhood cut off for 75 days",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/middleeast/israeli-strike-northern-gaza-aid-intl/,"Eleven people were killed in an Israeli air strike in central Gaza on Saturday night, including several members of one family, according to hospital authorities. Khalil Al-Daqran, spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, told CNN that others had been injured in the strike on a house east of Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. In a statement to CNN, the Israeli military said the strike targeted an “Islamic Jihad terrorist” operating in a building located in the humanitarian area of Deir al-Balah. The military also asserted that the reported number of casualties does not align with their information. Elsewhere, the Israeli military said that it had conducted a strike on Hamas operatives who were operating “inside a command and control center in the area of Daraj Tuffah” that it said was once a school in northern Gaza City. Gaza Civil Defense said Sunday that its teams had retrieved six bodies and a number of injured people from the site, which shelters displaced people. The IDF also reported ground operations in the Beit Lahia area on the northern edge of Gaza, “during which the troops eliminated numerous terrorists and dismantled terror infrastructure sites both above and below ground.” Gaza’s health ministry says Kamal Adwan hospital in the north of the Strip has been subject to intense fire since Saturday. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan, said Sunday that artillery shells had targeted the buildings near the hospital, and bombs were dropped in its courtyards by drones. The Israel Defense Forces told CNN it was unaware of any strikes or shelling on the hospital on Saturday. But the director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,described the reportsof strikes around Kamal Adwan – which has come under frequent fire - as “deeply worrisome.” However, the WHO said that it had been able to supply 5,000 liters of fuel to the hospital as well as blood supplies and had transferred eight patients to another hospital amid “ongoing hostilities and explosions close to the hospital during the mission.” A UN convoy with nine trucks was able to reach a neighborhood in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza that had been cut off from assistance for over 75 days. The convoy included two trucks of bottled water and seven of wheat flour and canned food, according to theWorld Food Programme. The humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate amid sky-high prices for food. A producer for CNN witnessed long queues for food at an NGO facility in central Gaza on Saturday. One woman, Yasra Salem Abu Al-Rous, said she was there to secure food for her children, as she could not afford flour and other basics. “If it weren’t for the charity, the situation would be unbearable,” she said. Another mother, Aya Al-Batoon, said her daughter’s pre-existing sickness had dramatically worsened during the conflict because of a lack of nutrition. “Before the war, her weight was about 9.5 kilograms; now, it has dropped to 4 kilograms due to the lack of food and water. Even if food is available, it’s too expensive — we can’t afford it for her,” she said. “Every time I look at her, I feel she won’t live much longer.” There have beensome signsof optimism about a truce between Israel and Hamas that would include the release of hostages but sticking points remain and Israeli forces continue to operate across Gaza.",World
"mall plane crashes into Brazilian city, killing all 10 people on board",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/americas/small-plane-crash-brazil-intl-latam/,"A small plane has crashed into an urban center in the southern Brazilian city of Gramado, killing all 10 people on board and injuring over a dozen more on the ground, according to Brazilian authorities. The crash happened minutes after the aircraft took off on Sunday morning, according to the National Civil Defense, where it collided with the chimney of a building, then with a residence, and finally into a furniture store. Debris also hit an inn, the civil defense added. The civil defense for Rio Grande do Sul, the region where Gramado is located, says at least 17 people were injured. Most were hospitalized due to inhaling smoke from fire caused by the accident, the region’s Public Security Department added. The Governor of Rio Grande do Sul Eduardo Leite said all 10 occupants of the aircraft died. The state civil defense said those who died were all part of the same family. Related articleCockpit recordings describe ‘a lot of icing’ before plane crashed in Brazil, says early report Leite had said earlier that two of those injured in the crash “seem to be in serious condition due to burns.” Video from the scene showed fire burning outside a building, with debris scattered all over the ground. The footage also showed an overcast sky with fog covering the area. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the tragedy. Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sent his condolences to the families of the victims in a post on X. “I hope that the injured have a speedy recovery. The Air Force is investigating the causes of the accident and the federal government is at the disposal of the state government and local authorities to clarify the situation as soon as possible,” he wrote. Gramado is considered a small mountain resort popular with tourists, especially around Christmas, when the area boasts hundreds of holiday attractions.

Albania bans TikTok for a year after killing of teenager,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/europe/albania-tiktok-ban-intl/,"Albania on Saturday announced a one-year ban onTikTok, the popular short video app, following the killing of a teenager last month that raised fears over the influence of social media on children. The ban, part of a broader plan to make schools safer, will come into effect early next year, Prime Minister Edi Rama said after meeting with parents’ groups and teachers from across the country. “For one year, we’ll be completely shutting it down for everyone. There will be no TikTok in Albania,” Rama said. Several European countries includingFrance, Germany and Belgium have enforced restrictions on social media use for children. In one of the world’s toughest regulations targeting Big Tech, Australia approved in November acomplete social media banfor children under 16. Rama has blamed social media, and TikTok in particular, for fueling violence among youth in and outside school. His government’s decision comes after a 14-year-old schoolboy was stabbed to death in November by a fellow pupil. Local media had reported that the incident followed arguments between the two boys on social media. Videos had also emerged on TikTok of minors supporting the killing. “The problem today is not our children, the problem today is us, the problem today is our society, the problem today is TikTok and all the others that are taking our children hostage,” Rama said. TikTok said it was seeking “urgent clarity” from the Albanian government. “We found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok,” a company spokesperson said.",World

Toss it or wash it: Household items that love to harbor bacteria,https://www.cnn.com/wbd/toss-it-or-wash-it-household-items-that-love-to-harbor-bacteria/,"Our homes are filled with items that have the potential to harbor bacteria. We’ve highlighted some of the most common offenders so that you can replace or clean them on a regular basis. Keep your razor in the shower? Big mistake. According to theAmerican Academy of Dermatology, you should dry out your razor completely from shave to shave to prevent bacteria from growing on it. Even when stored in a dry area, razors don’t have a long shelf life. The AAD recommends throwing away disposable razors after five to seven shaves. The same goes for hand towels, dish towels and washcloths. These items should be washed frequently with hot water. If your towels are white, you can add a cap full of bleach to the wash, too. Compared to other household items, the toothbrush isn’t that germy — it didn’t make the NSF top 30 list. However, the toothbrush holder did in a major way. (See the next slide for the reason.) Still, it’s important to replace toothbrushes frequently (every three to four months, according to theAmerican Dental Association) and immediately if someone in your home has a virus. Bacteria love wet places, and your makeup is no exception. Make sure you wash your hands before handling liquid foundation and concealers to prevent spreading germs and toss your liquid makeup after about six months. Just like liquid foundation, mascara creates a wet environment bacteria love. Replace your mascara every couple of months and never, ever share eye makeup. Makeup sponges, such as the Beautyblender, are great for getting that flawless, airbrushed look. But if it’s been a while since you cleaned your sponge, you’re not doing your skin any favors and you might be spreading bacteria onto your face.Clean your sponges regularly with this technique, and replace them about every three months. You wash your bed sheets frequently, but how often do you wash your pet’s bed? Dogs can track in small amounts of fecal matter from outside, so if you’re not washing your pet bed, it may be time to toss and replace. Look for a machine-washable bed, or one with a removable cover. When was the last time you washed your pet’s toys? Cloth toys such as tennis balls and plastic toys with little nooks and crannies are the perfect home for mold and yeast. The NSF also found a high amount of staph in pet toys swabbed. A contact lens case doesn’t seem like something that would need replacing — especially since it literally holds contact cleaner. But when you handle your contacts and case, you transfer germs from your hands into the case and reservoir. When dealing with items that go directly onto your eyeballs, it’s best to replace occasionally. And always wash your hands before handling contacts. Your child’s bath toys may be harboring mold, especially if the toys have openings that you can’t completely dry off after bath time. Make sure toys are stored in a dry place and not kept in the shower. Related articleThe ultimate cleaning schedule: How and when to clean everything in your house It’s important to thoroughly clean your toilet brush after each use before placing it back in the toilet brush holder. Otherwise, the same situation that happens with a kitchen sponge and sponge holder or a toothbrush and toothbrush holder can occur. And if anyone in your home gets a stomach bug or virus, toss the toilet brush after using and replace with a new brush. An air humidifier is a godsend during the winter months, but if you just pack it up and place it back in the closet after the season, your humidifier is probably harboring some serious mold. Make sure to keep filters clean and dry out components completely after each use. According to the NSF study, your cutting board is dirtier than your toilet seat. If that seems crazy, consider this: Every cut made in the cutting board creates a tiny home for bacteria to breed. If you’re using a plastic cutting board, swap out for wood as most wood cutting boards have resins that are antibacterial. Most people think the bathroom is the germiest place in the house, but according to a swab study from theNational Sanitation Foundation, it’s actually the kitchen. By a lot. And the germiest item in the kitchen? Your dish sponges. The kitchen sponge outranked all other household items for staph, mold, yeast and Coliform bacteria. Disinfect your sponge every other day by moistening it and microwaving it on high for one or two minutes and replace every two weeks. That cute little frog holder or sponge caddy isn’t clean either. Any area that constantly remains wet creates the perfect breeding environment for bacteria. Every time you change out your sponge, clean out your sponge holder. Like bath towels, bathmats are constantly exposed to damp, dark environments bacteria love. But unlike bath towels, bathmats aren’t washed frequently. If you have a cloth bathmat and can’t easily wash and dry it completely, throw it out. The coffee maker made NSF’s top 10 germiest items list and outranked the toilet seat with more Coliform bacteria. Why? The reservoir. Even if you toss the coffee filter and grounds immediately after making coffee, the reservoir can still breed bacteria. Make sure to keep the lid up after making coffee to help the reservoir dry out. You wash your plates and bowls after every meal, but how often do you wash your pet’s bowls? In their swab study, the NSF found mold, staph, Coliform and even E. coli in pet food and water bowls. If you’re still using plastic, swap out your pet’s bowls for stainless steel (which are less likely to get chips and cracks where bacteria can grow) and wash frequently. It may not seem like something to clean frequently—especially since food is often wrapped inside—but the lunchbox can harbor a lot of germs. Food waste mixed with thawed ice packs create a great home for mold and yeast. While pillows aren’t typically a bacteria culprit, they do harbor dust mites, dead skin cells and body oils. Most pillows can be thrown in the washer, but if not, it’s time to replace. If you suffer from bad allergies, try replacing or cleaning your pillows every couple of months. Dust, dirt, oil from skin and hair, sweat, lotion and conditioners can leave your baseball cap looking less than new in no time. Whether dirty from tearing around the bases during Little League or after working in the garden, hats and baseball caps will last longer with routine cleaning and washing. If your cleaning routine for the shower doesn’t include the shower head filter, you’re missing a crucial piece. The head itself could be shiny and spotless, but if this interior piece isn’t sanitized every couple of months, you’re not getting the healthiest, cleanest water. And while you’re likely not drinking large amounts of shower water, clean water is critical for skin and haircare. Dirt, dust and wax routinely come into contact with your Apple AirPods, making your expensive earbuds and their expensive charging casement look ragged and worn. What happens when you delay cleaning them? Bad things. Not only do they start to look really grimy, but as you might expect, all that gunk wreaks havoc on their performance as well. By using a microfiber cloth and toothpick for a regular cleaning, your Apple AirPods will sound better and be less grimy.","Everyday, Health"
Breastfeeding can be hard and lonely. These women are trying to change that,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/business/breastfeeding-support-apps-companies/,"In the hours after her daughter was born, Andrea Ippolito already felt like she was falling short as a mother. “Here I was, just like many women, trying to recover after this insane medical procedure of giving birth, and I just felt like a failure,” she told CNN.Ippolito was struggling to breastfeed because of her low milk supply. Even now, about six years later, the memory makes her emotional. “My daughter was dropping weight,” she recalled. “It was just incredibly stressful.” Ippolito ended up feeding her daughter a combination of breast milk and baby formula until she was three months old, when Ippolito weaned her off breast milk altogether. “It was a struggle the entire time,” she said. The American Academy of Pediatricsrecommends that infants consume only breast milk— no formula — until they are about 6 months old. But at that age, just 56% of US babies consume any breast milk,according the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And only a quarter of6-month-olds are exclusively breast fed. But for some women or birthing parents, exclusive breastfeeding or chestfeeding is simply not possible because of inadequate supply. Many stopbecause they lack much-needed structuraland emotional support and wean before they had planned to. Ippolito thinks that more help in those early days would have improved her experience, both practically and emotionally. So in 2019 she started SimpliFed, a virtual platform that partners with health plans and doctors to get patients insurance-covered breastfeeding support from International Board-Certified Lactation Consultants, or IBCLCs, among other things. “Our posture as an organization is whatever your goals are, we’ll support you,” she said. Hers is one of a number of young tech companies connecting new parents to a network of support. It’s a growing area: In 2024 postpartum services, including lactation consulting, amounted to a $13.74 billion industry,according to the market research company Mordor Intelligence. The postpartum services market, which may include apps, virtual platforms and other technological solutions, will hit $22.6 billion by 2029, Mordor predicts. “Over the last decade, there’s finally been this recognition … that women’s health has been dramatically underserved,” said Ippolito, noting that there remainsroom for improvement. Investors are “looking at what’s next and where there’s going to be continued market opportunity. And that’s where they’re looking at postpartum care services like ours.” Still, it’s an uphill battle. Even when everything goes well, breastfeeding is taxing. In the very beginning, newbornstypically get hungry every one to three hours. That means multiple feedings a day, including overnight. In the months that follow, babies often nurse 8 to 12 times a day — a slower pace, but not by much. Then there are the potential problems, likeoversupply,undersupplyand a nasty infection calledmastitis, which canexacerbate the normal difficulties. Parentswho are still breastfeeding when they return to work need regular breaks and a clean, suitable place to pump and store breast milk during the day. So it’s not surprising that breastfeeding rates fall off, especially when parents can’t access help. But breastfeeding offers great benefits to both children and parents, according to experts. Breast milk is “like the baby’s first vaccine and protection against infection” because mothers pass antibodies to children through their milk, explained Ann Kellams, a pediatrician who is the founder and director of the University of Virginia’s Breastfeeding and Lactation Medicine program. It’s also a dynamic substance. “The content of the breast milk changes with the environment, with the time of year in which infections are going around, and also with each developmental stage of the baby,” she said. “It is personalized.” Studies suggest that breastfed babies havelower risks of illnessand chronic health problems, and that breastfeeding parents have lower risks ofmaternal diabetes and hypertension. And it’s not all or nothing, noted Kellams. “Any breastfeeding, any drop, is important and meaningful.” To help increase rates of breastfeeding in the US, the 2010Affordable Care Act requiredsome employers to give nursing parents a private space and enough time to pump breast milk during the day. It also stated that health insurance plans must cover lactation support services and products, like pumps. The mandate, however, didn’t do much at first. So entrepreneurs stepped in. When it came to lactation care “the ACA was kind of shouting into the void,” said Sarah Kellogg Neff, CEO of the Lactation Network. Lactation consultants hadn’t at that point worked with insurance, she said. And many parents didn’t even know what lactation consultants were. In 2016, “we were among the first people anywhere to get reimbursed at all for this care, and that was four years into ACA implementation,” said Neff. The Lactation Network, which has its roots as a breast pump seller, now has the largest network of IBCLCs in the United States, according to the company. While SimpliFed and the Lactation Network focus on connecting parents with insurance-covered lactation consultations and other healthcare, Pumpspotting is mostly about helping parents find each other. For Amy VanHaren, who founded the app in 2015 and serves as its CEO, breastfeeding was an isolating experience. “Every day I was either nursing or pumping, or thinking about the next nursing and pumping session, and just constantly feeling inadequate and alone and really uncertain,” she said. For VanHaren, community was crucial. “I was missing the connection point to other women who were in this phase of life, who were dealing with the same emotional struggles.” In the Pumpspotting app, users share stories, ask questions and raise concerns. People respond to each other, and lactation consultants jump in to weigh in on specific queries. This year Pumpspotting also sent out Barb, its Breast Express Bus, on a national tour. The brightly-painted vehicle opened its doors to curious parents across the country, giving them a cheery place to nurse and browse through breastfeeding accessories. Pumpspotting has a few revenue streams. There is a premium version of the app for $9.99 a month that VanHaren hopes will be covered by employers. And Pumpspotting has brand partners whose ads might appear in the app. It also serves as a consultant for companies that need help complying with legislation likethe recent PUMP Act, which builds on the ACA’s requirement of lactation rooms at work. Consulting could be big business for the company, said Matt Douglas, founder and CEO of Sincere Corporation, which includes virtual brands like the photo app Timehop and ecard platform Punchbowl. Sincere announced aninvestment in Pumpspottinglast year. “Every single company in this country should have a Pumpspotting seal of approval,” Douglas said. “Not only is it the right thing to do as an employer, but it’s also a risk mitigation,” he added. “I think it’s a huge opportunity.” Not everyone sees it that way. “Being a solo female founder of a breastfeeding technology company … it’s always been a complex journey to get the funds,” said VanHaren. “We have a long way to go.” The Lactation Network is privately held and doesn’t have external investment, Neff said. But she pays attention to how investors are approaching women’s health — and some are all talk. “There’s a lot of conversation, but there’s not a whole lot of skin in the game yet.” Some healthcare professionals have their own concerns. Gayle Shipp, an assistant professor at Michigan State University’s public health department and a board member of the Michigan Breastfeeding Network, said it’s important to consider the mission of groups providing lactation care. “Who’s on the board… and then beyond that, is there diversity?” There areracial and socioeconomic disparities in breastfeeding rates, she noted, so “how are those companies considering that?” Ultimately, she said “transparency is probably key for all of them.” Kellams fears that for-profit companies could end up with conflicts of interest and said she would prefer that solutions stay in the public sector. But she acknowledges that “there’s a gap in what the traditional care is providing,” and that something has to change. “As a society we put so much pressure on new families to do everything perfectly, and we don’t talk about what it’s really like to be postpartum and how much that really stinks and how hard it is,” Kellams said. “There’s just so many things that we can help with. But it’s going to take changing the way we give care.”","Business, Health"
Online dating is about to radically change,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/tech/why-dating-may-look-radically-different-in-5-years/,"Personalized chatbots dating other chatbots on your behalf. AI concierges fielding questions about potential matches. Advanced algorithms predicting compatibility better than ever before. Dating apps are on the cusp of a major transformation. As much of the tech industry grapples with how to integrate artificial intelligence into its products, dating companies are weighing how the technology could usher in a significant shift in the way people connect and meet online. At its investor day last week, executives from Match Group — the parent company of Match.com, Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, Our Time and more —teased plansto use AI to improve user experiences and help make better connections. Justin McLeod, CEO of Hinge, outlined how the company intends to fully embrace AI next year: more personalized matching, smarter algorithms that adapt to usersand better understand them over time and AI coaching for struggling daters. “While AI is not going to be a panacea when it comes to the very deeply and personal problem of love, I can tell you that it is going to transform the dating app experience, taking it from a do-it-yourself platform to an expertly guided journey that leads to far better outcomes and much better value to our daters,” he told investors. Although machine learning has been quietly working behind the scenes in dating apps for years — most notably as the force behind match-recommendation engines — advanced AI could elevate matchmaking by making it more effective and creative. It’s already starting to play a bigger role. Tinder, for example, uses AI to help users select their best profile photos. Meanwhile, Bumble’s recently enhanced“For You” roundupuses advanced AI when delivering its daily set of four curated profiles based on a user’s preferences and past matches. Bumble also uses AI in safety features like itsPrivate Detector— an AI-powered tool that blurs explicit images — andDeception Detector, which identifies spam, scams and fake profiles. Similarly, Match Group offers tools like buttons that say “Are You Sure?” to detect harmful language and “Does This Bother You?” to prompt users to report inappropriate behavior. But these forms of AI are only scratching the surface of what’s possible. Lidiane Jones, CEO of Bumble, told CNN there is “tremendous opportunity for innovation in the dating app market.” “In building out AI, as in all endeavors, we will advocate for women and continue to build the next chapter that puts women first,” she said. “We’ll continue to invest in our current model while finding new ways for people to build relationships, and we see a future where AI can help to foster this.” According to Liesel Sharabi, an associate professor at Arizona State University’s Hugh Downs School of Human Communication, the dating industry is still “very much in the early stages” of embracing AI. “The platforms are still figuring out its role in the online dating experience, but it really does have the potential to transform this space.” That’s also because the dating industry is ripe for change, she argued. Tinder made waves in 2012 by introducing the swiping mechanism, which has since been widely adopted. But apps have largely stayed the same since then, even as user burnout grows and smarter ways to connect are in demand. About 46% of Americans have had a very or somewhat negative experience with online dating, according todatafrom the Pew Research Center. “The timing feels right for something new and different to happen — and that could be with AI,” Sharabi said. The potential for integrating more AI into apps is vast. Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd previouslysaidshe envisions AI functioning as a dating concierge, helping users navigate matches, set up dates and respond to messages. Startups such as Volar and Rizz have alreadyexperimentedwith chatbots that help respond to messages. On Rizz, users upload screenshots of conversations they’re having on other dating apps, and the platform helps create flirty replies. (Volar, a standalone dating appthat trains on users’ preferences and automatically responds to other chatbots, shut down in September due to lack of funding.) While the concept of chatbots dating on your behalf may seem strange, it could reduce the tedious early-stage communication by focusing more on highly compatible matches, Sharabi said. “It’s possible that building AI into platforms will allow people to meet more quickly or find better-suited matches,” Sharabi said. She also believes dating apps will have to address user concerns about whether they’re talking to a real person. After all, some users are already leaning on AI through services such as ChatGPT to help write profiles or respond to messages. Dating platforms will likely add some of the tools directly into the app in a creative yet controlled way. An AI dating coach, for example, could explain compatibility scores, suggest icebreakers or help users navigate conversations. During Match Group’s investor day, Hinge’s McLeod announced plans to build the “world’s most knowledgeable dating coach” using years of insights from the dating process. “Dating isn’t easy. Many people using the app don’t get that first match and don’t know why — whether it’s their photos, not sending enough likes or taking too long to ask a match on a date. A dating coach can step in with personalized suggestions,” he said. Sharabi said the concept of an AI dating coach “makes a lot of sense” because it’s not uncommon to be out with friends and co-workers when looking for love and there’s “someone to bounce ideas off of.” “We don’t have that on dating apps,” she added. “It’d be like having a wingman,something we did when meeting face-to-face,but bringing that into the digital dating experience.” Hinge is also working on a more personalized algorithm that gathers detailed information from users, asking them to describe what they value most and provide feedback on what is or isn’t working on the platform. “Imagine a future where daters tell our algorithm in their own words what’s important to them and what they’re looking for,” McLeod said. “As a result, we will be better able to match them with a level of precision that up until this point hasn’t been possible.… This is just the starting point.” McLeod said Hinge has already seen a higher number of matches and subscription renewals with its improved AI algorithm among early test groups. It plans to roll this out globally in March.

Here’s what happened,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/tech/openai-chatgpt-phone-call/,"When a CNN journalist called 1-800-CHATGPT on Wednesday, a female voice on the other end provided a recipe for chocolate chip cookies and summarized the Civil War. But the voice did not seem open to personal conversation. “I don’t have feelings, but I do find my job pretty interesting,” the chatbot said. ChatGPT – introduced just over two years agoas a chat-capable artificial intelligence bot online- is now hitting the phones. By dialing 1-800-242-8478 in the US, those new to the world of AI chatbots can try out OpenAI without downloading the app, the company announced on Wednesday, and have a voice conversation over a regular phone. OpenAI said it’s useful for people who don’t have consistent access to high-speed data. Anyone around the world can also message the number on WhatsApp to communicate with the chatbot. The company said users will have 15 minutes available per month to call ChatGPT. The tool, advertised as an “experimental way” to talk to the chatbot, doesn’t have the same breadth of abilities as the full ChatGPT. For example, the call won’t be as personalized as using the app. The feature was built “just a few weeks ago,” according to an OpenAIlivestream, as part of a rapid series of updates and tools for the company’s “12 Days of OpenAI” campaign. There have been questions raised over the chatbot’s voice technology. In an August report, OpenAIexpressed concernthat users might get too dependent on its human-sounding voice mode. When asked if users agree for OpenAI to record or keep their voice by using the feature, the company directed CNN to its privacy policy and Terms of Use. Before users begin speaking to ChatGPT over the phone, they agree to OpenAI’sTerms of Useandprivacy policyby proceeding (there are various clauses on the personal data that it collects). The company also gives a disclaimer that it may review the data for safety purposes. In addition to AI concerns, OpenAI is also facing some steep competition and pressures to reach profitability. It’s directly coming for Google with itssearch engine, though Google is also releasing snazzy new technology like a tool that lets peopleupload photosto get back combined AI-generated images. And then there’s Elon Musk’s xAI,Meta AIand Microsoft’s Bing (which uses OpenAI’s technology). In October, OpenAIannounceda record-breaking $6.6 billion private funding round, boosting the company’s valuation to $157 billion. When asked on Wednesday if ChatGPT would ever turn a profit, the cheery bot voice answered a CNN journalist that OpenAI plans to eventually. But, the bot added, “I don’t handle any money myself.”",Technology
World’s largest iceberg has broken free after being trapped in vortex,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/climate/worlds-biggest-iceberg-a23a-moving-intl-scli/,"The world’slargest icebergis on the move again, drifting through the Southern Ocean after monthsstuck spinningon the same spot, scientists from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have said. Spanning an area of 3,672 square kilometers (1,418-square-miles) when measured in August – slightly bigger than Rhode Island – the A23a iceberg has been carefully tracked by scientists ever since it calved from the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf in 1986. It remained grounded on the Antarctic’s Weddell Sea floor for more than 30 years, probably until it shrank just enough to loosen its grip on the seafloor. Then, the iceberg was carried away by ocean currents before it became stuck again in a Taylor column – the name given to a spinning vortex of water caused by ocean currents hitting an underwater mountain. Now that the iceberg has broken free, scientists expect it will continue drifting along the ocean currents toward warmer water and the remote island of South Georgia, where it is likely to break up and eventually melt, BAS said in a statement published Friday. A23a has held the “largest current iceberg” title several times since the 1980s, occasionally being surpassed by larger but shorter-lived icebergs, including A68 in 2017 and A76 in 2021. Related articleStriking photos show arches and cavernous hollows carved into world’s largest iceberg Scientists have said that, while this particular iceberg probably broke away as part of the natural growth cycle of the ice shelf and won’t contribute to rising sea levels, climate change is drivingworrying changesin this vast, isolated continent, with potentially devastating consequences for global sea level rise. Throughout the iceberg’s journey, scientists have studied its erosion as well as the ways in which sea ice can influence global ocean cycles of carbon and nutrients. “We know that these giant icebergs can provide nutrients to the waters they pass through, creating thriving ecosystems in otherwise less productive areas,” Laura Taylor, a biogeochemist who collected samples from the water around the iceberg, said in the BAS statement. “What we don’t know is what difference particular icebergs, their scale, and their origins can make to that process. “We took samples of ocean surface waters behind, immediately adjacent to, and ahead of the iceberg’s route. They should help us determine what life could form around A23a and how it impacts carbon in the ocean and its balance with the atmosphere.” CNN’s Amy Woodyatt, Jack Guy and Taylor Nicioli contributed to this report.",Science
‘I’m an impatient person:’ This young CEO wants to capture carbon emissions from ships,https://www.cnn.com/climate/seabound-shipping-industry-alisha-fredriksson-spc/,"Alisha Fredriksson says she had one motivation for starting her latest business venture: “to tackle the climate crisis and to have as big of an impact as possible.” Fredriksson is CEO of UK climate tech startup Seabound, which is developing an onboard carbon capture device for cargo ships. Global shipping, which accounts for about3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, aims to reach net zero by or around 2050, like many other industries. However, it’s still looking for solutions that will help companies achieve that target. “I think I’m maybe an impatient person, but for me, shipping is not moving fast enough to decarbonize,” says Fredriksson. Seabound’s technology, which can be housed in one or more standard shipping containers, takes the exhaust fumes from the engines and runs the CO2 contained in them through an accelerated version of a naturalprocessthat’s been happening in the oceans for billions of years. The container is filled with pebbles made of calcium oxide, known as lime, which absorb the CO2. “You can basically picture a box of rocks,” Fredriksson says, “the exhaust gasses pass through there and the CO2 is soaked up and turned into limestone, while the rest is released.” It’s a fairly simple process, she adds, because the CO2 is simply trapped. “That’s everything we do on board — we don’t separate the CO2, we don’t purify it or compress it, because those steps are really energy intensive and quite complicated to do on board. So we’ve shifted the complicated stuff to happen on shore instead.” Once the ships docks at a port, the pebbles can be offloaded for further treatment at a specialized plant, including separating the CO2 to use them again, or recycling them as construction material. Seabound has run tests that it says confirmed the viability of the process, by capturing 80% of the carbon and 90% of the sulfur, a pollutant that is already captured aboardabout 5%of the global merchant fleet using similar systems. Fredriksson says the company is in talks with several shipping companies and is gearing up to launch commercially before the end of 2025. Fredriksson, with co-founder Roujia Wen, started Seabound in 2021, aged 26 but already boasting a resumethat included launching a climate program at a global non-profit and building a maritime green fuel startup called Liquid Wind. In 2023, she made Forbes’ 30 Under 30 EuropeSocial Impact listand the MIT’s Tech ReviewInnovators Under 35 list. “It’s still fairly uncertain what the future of decarbonized shipping will look like,” she says. “There’s alternative fuels, the main contenders being green methanol and green ammonia, but there isn’t a fuel supply (for them) yet, and those fuels aren’t compatible with the existing fleet. So we have about 100,000 ships on the water today that will keep releasing CO2 for the foreseeable future.” One of the advantages of the Seabound system, Fredriksson adds, is that it generates heat and therefore doesn’t require additional energy or burn any fuel. The space occupied onboard – which determines how much money the ship will lose in reduced cargo capacity — depends on the size of the vessel and the amount of CO2 to capture. “Picture a 20-foot shipping container,” she says. “You could have as many as you want, depending on how much you want to capture. We work with our customers to figure out what is the target percent of CO2 to capture, but in general, we’re looking to cap (the space we use) at ideally less than 1% of cargo capacity.” The installation is relatively simple as it only requires piping to connect the Seabound container to the engine exhaust system. Once the ship has completed its journey, the pebbles — which become slightly heavier but not larger — are offloaded by swapping the Seabound containers with new ones. Once at port, the pebbles can go through the opposite reaction that occurred onboard, by heating them up in a kiln to separate the CO2 and make them ready to absorb it again; the resulting pure CO2 can be made into products like fuels or chemicals, or be sequestered underground. This closed loop model would make the pebbles reusable, but requires specific infrastructure to be built at ports or nearby, to complete the process. Another option is to use the pebbles as building material, as they are made of limestone, a common ingredient in concrete. This would require less infrastructure at ports, but there are still uncertainties about the applications for the limestone, because it’s been exposed to impurities from the ship’s exhaust. “It wouldn’t be suitable for super high-grade applications like water purification, for example, because there might be contaminants,” says Fredriksson. You could think of it as an aggregate, for instance, in concrete or road construction, where there’s less sensitivity to impurities.” Seabound completed a pilot run last year with global shipping company Lomar, putting one of its devices aboard a medium-sized, 3,200-container vessel, where it achieved the 80% carbon capture. “While this was a prototype device, it was a critical technical proof and a milestone for us. And since then, we’ve essentially been building up our commercial products. Long term, we want to be able to capture carbon on any type of ship all over the world.” There is growing interest in onboard carbon capture systems (OCCS) like Seabound’s, but their implementation is not straightforward. Aprojectcarried out by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), an association of large oil and gas companies looking for climate change solutions, and the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), a Singapore-based climate nonprofit, tested a different system that produced liquefied CO2, made using non-proprietary equipment and processes — so results could be shared publicly — on a medium-range oil tanker. Results suggest a potential reduction in CO2 emissions by up to 20% per year, with a fuel consumption penalty of just under 10%. However, it also found that the cost of building and installing such a system on the ship was an estimated $13.6 million. “The adoption of OCCS faces significant challenges, particularly its high capital cost for retrofit and operational cost associated with additional fuel consumption,” says Lynn Loo, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Princeton University and CEO of the GCMD. While at scale costs could go down by as much as 75%, she adds, the test revealed other critical bottlenecks, such as the lack of port infrastructure for liquefied CO2 offloading and the absence of a global regulatory framework for managing CO2 that is captured in international waters. According to Fredriksson, that project used a “more conventional” form of carbon capture compared to Seabound’s second-generation one, which leaves most of the complex tasks and machinery off the ship to reduce costs and increase scalability. Similar technologies that don’t involve unloading anything at ports are also in development, such as one being tested by Calcarea, an offshoot of The California Institute of Technology, which is designed to discharge the CO2 directly into the sea as carbonate-rich water. Related articleNew tech will trap CO2 from cargo ships and store it in the ocean “We know and like the team there, and I’m actually really curious about the potential combination of our solutions,” says Fredriksson, “because we make limestone, and they start with limestone. If we could integrate our technologies, we could potentially capture double the amount of CO2 onboard using the same amount of lime as in Seabound’s current system.” According to Tristan Smith, a professor of Energy and Transport at the University College London, OCCS could take on “a transient role” before hydrogen-derived fuels become more competitive by the mid-2030s. “There is not a positive outlook for (OCCS) use in shipping,” he says. “This does not mean it isn’t popular — it is attractive to imagine a technology that could allow continued use of fossil fuel. But a positive view is linked to a simplification of the realities of the business case fundamentals, which are less compelling than solutions that are coupled to renewable energy (green ammonia).” Faisal Khan, a professor of chemical engineering and petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University and the director of theOcean Engineering Safety Institutebelieves that forms of carbon capture aboard ships will become “almost mandatory in the coming years, similarly to what happened in the automobile industry with catalytic converters.” He sees potential in Seabound’s technology due to the benefits of mimicking a natural process. “The bottleneck remains the efficiency of these processes, because the exhaust (gas) is unfortunately not pure carbon dioxide, it comes with a lot more impurities. And these impurities affect efficiency,” he says. However, he is optimistic about the commercial prospects of OCCS. “Whether it will last or stand the scrutiny of time until we have better options is unsure,” he says, “but in the short to medium term, these are promising technologies.”","Science, Business"
Microplastics are choking our waters. Could a sponge made of squid bones help remove them?,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/science/microplastics-sponge-wuhan-china-scn-intl-hnk/,"Microplastics are everywhere. They have been found on thepeak of Mount Everestand in creaturesinhabiting the deepest trenches of the sea. They’re inbottled water,human placentasandbreast milk. These tiny plastic particles choke wildlife, disrupt ecosystems, and threaten human health – and they are notoriously difficult to remove. But scientists in China have come up with a possible solution: a biodegradable sponge made of squid bones and cotton. A research team from Wuhan University used chitin from squid bones and cellulose from cotton – two organic compounds known for eliminating pollution from wastewater – to create a biodegradable sponge. They then tested the sponge in four different water samples, taken from irrigation water, pond water, lake water and sea water, and found it removed up to 99.9% of microplastics, according to astudy published last month in Science Advances. “The planet is under great threat from microplastics, and aquatic ecosystems are the first to suffer,” wrote the authors. “Even under a variety of policies, including plastic product reduction, waste management, and environmental recycling, microplastic pollution is irreversible and escalating.” Microplastics are tiny shards of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters. They come from everything from tires, which are then broken down into smaller pieces, to microbeads, a plastic found in beauty products such as exfoliants. One study from 2020 estimated there are14 million metric tons of microplastics sitting on the ocean floor. Scientistshave calledmicroplastics “one of this generation’s key environmental challenges” and the problem is aninternationally recognizedenvironmental issue. Plastic is a persistent pollution that hurts wildlife, the ocean itself and there’sgrowing concernabout the potential health risks it poses to humans. The problem is only set to get worse with plastic production and pollutionexpected to increasein the coming years. Even if we embarked on an immediate and globally coordinated effort to reduce plastic consumption, anestimated 710 million metric tonsof plastic would still pollute the environment by 2040, according to another study. That makes finding solutions to get rid of the plastics contaminating our oceans all the more urgent. The sponge created by the Wuhan researchers was able to absorb microplastics both by physically intercepting them and through electromagnetic attraction, the study said. Previously studied methods for absorbing plastics tend to be expensive and difficult to make, limiting their scalability. Last year, researchers in Qingdao, Chinadeveloped a synthetic spongemade of starch and gelatin designed to remove microplastics from water, though its efficacy varied depending on water conditions. Related articleMicroplastics are in many of your body’s organs and tissues. Why they’re so bad and what you can do to stay healthier The low cost and wide availability of both cotton and squid bones mean the sponge created in Wuhan “has great potential to be used in the extraction of microplastic from complex water bodies,” according to the study. Shima Ziajahromi, a lecturer at Australia’s Griffith University who studies microplastics, called the squid-cotton-sponge method “promising” and said it could be an effective way to “clean up the high risk and vulnerable aquatic ecosystem.” However, the study’s authors did not address whether the sponge can remove microplastics that sink to the sediment, which is the majority of microplastics in our waters, said Ziajahromi, who was not involved in the study. Another “critical issue” is the proper disposal of the sponges, Ziajahromi said. “Although the material is biodegradable, the microplastics it absorbs need to be disposed of properly,” she said. “Without careful management, this process risks transferring microplastics from one ecosystem to another.” Ultimately, Ziajahromi added, minimizing plastic pollution is in the first place should remain a “top priority.”",Science
Penn State’s James Franklin wins a big one. More big ones are coming,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/sport/james-franklin-penn-state-win-spt/,"By most measures of football success, James Franklin’s tenure at Penn State has been satisfying. A 100-41 record over 11 seasons, one Big Ten championship, a slew of players in the NFL. But there’s always been one question hanging over the Nittany Lions’ head coach: When was he going to win the big one? Aside from a victory over Wisconsin in the 2016 Big Ten championship game, Franklin’s Penn State teams often came up short on the biggest stages. In front of 106,031 raucous fans on Saturday,Franklin won one of those big ones in the school’s debut in the College Football Playoff. Now there are bigger stages with brighter lights looming. The Nittany Lions’ 38-10 victory over Southern Methodist University lacked dramatics once the home team started forcing turnovers and the din created by the Penn State faithful appeared to get to SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings. The Nittany Lions were simply more poised and took advantage of the Mustangs’ mistakes. That experience – in cold weather, in Beaver Stadium, in pressure games – paid off for the Nittany Lions. It led to a party in the stands that lasted most of the 60 minutes of Saturday’s game and will continue throughout the night in this scenic town tucked away in central Pennsylvania’s Appalachian Mountains – likely indoors after conditions in University Park that made the game feel every bit like it was taking place on the first day of winter. It was the kind of moment the Penn State community has been looking forward to for years. One of college football’s most intense fanbases, the Nittany Lions’ fans have cringed in recent years as the team has fallen just short of a College Football Playoff berth over and over. But Franklin wasn’t shy about reminding the press after the game about his track record. “We played in a bunch of them,” Franklin said about high-profile bowl games. “Dramatic pause, so everybody can take that in. We played in a bunch of them. My family, we’re used to spending Christmas in hotels. Not everybody is.” With the expanded playoff this season, PSU not only got into the field but won the right to host a home game. Thanks to the CFP rules, they’ve also now got a favorable quarterfinal matchup against Boise State University in the Fiesta Bowl on New Year’s Eve. It’s a place where Penn State feels comfortable – the program is 7-0 all-time in the desert. Any rumblings in Happy Valley over whether Franklin would be able to push this program to the heights the PSU community feels it deserves will likely quiet now. And there were rumblings –TNT Sports analysts Champ Bailey and Takeo Spikesbelieved Saturday’s game against SMU represented a must-win situation for Franklin. “When you look at all the prior years, Penn State would always finish anywhere from nine to 12 in the rankings,” Spikes toldCNN Sport. “This has been a high ranking to where they are now, and you’re fortunate enough to be able to get a home game. This is the thing that really puts a lot of pressure on these guys, especially Coach Franklin. When you look at where they’re slotted, they’re really slotted in a good chance … is really set up for them to have success.” Bailey put it much more succinctly. “He better win this game,” the Hall of Famer said. “This is it. … You gotta win this game. Yeah, his career might be on the line for this one, at least at Penn State.” That pressure is certainly lifted somewhat off Franklin and his staff. But he emphasized that he doesn’t see the win – a milestone 100th at Penn State – as being about him specifically. “I appreciate you bringing up the 100 wins and all that kind of stuff. But to me, I’m at a point in my career it’s all about the players. It’s all about the players, the staff, you know,” he said. Still, offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki said the win was a product of how Franklin has built the Penn State program – especially as Franklin just made history by winning the school’s first College Football Playoff game. “To speak of the tradition of this place, to have football as long as this place has had it, to have this state in the way it is, and to do something that’s never been done here – it’s pretty freakin’ rare. It’s pretty cool to be part of it,” he said. “Honestly, I feel like just a spoke in the flywheel that he’s created here. You know I’m the offensive coordinator, it’s an important position. But he doesn’t get enough credit for what he’s done here consistently, honestly.” Defeating a SMU team that was the last team into the playoff field isn’t enough for the longtime head coach of the Nittany Lions. There are still big questions about how Franklin’s teams perform under the brightest lights. At Penn State, Franklin is 1-18 against teams ranked in the top five – including a devastating 1-10 against archrival Ohio State. The former Vanderbilt head coach won’t be able to face another top five team until the semifinal round, should the Nittany Lions defeat the Broncos; both the University of Georgia and Notre Dame are ranked in the top five of the final College Football Playoff rankings. “I don’t care what anybody says about me or my team or my coach. At the end of the day, our process is our process, and at the end of the day, the only opinions that matter are the ones that are in the Lasch (Football) Building day to day,” said quarterback Drew Allar after the game. “… And in terms of, you know, Coach Franklin – he gets a lot of criticism that’s undeserved, and he’s done a lot, like, a lot more than people give him getting credit for. And obviously, winning, winning his 100th game is special. To be a part of that and be the team that you know is able to deliver that 100th team win to him, and to have it on the stage like the playoffs and at home in Beaver Stadium, it’s truly special. And, you know, we don’t take these moments for granted.” But behind a balanced offense – Penn State rushed for 189 yards and passed for 136 yards Saturday against SMU – and the nation’s sixth-ranked defense, Franklin has a squad that seems to be playing its best football at the right time of year. With the playoff weight successfully lifted off his shoulders, Franklin and Penn State certainly looked like a possible national champion Saturday afternoon. “A lot of college coaches I saw this week talking about, you know, this is a four-game season. It’s not. It was a one game season with an average of 65 plays on offense, 65 plays on defense, and 20 plays on special teams,” Franklin said. He added, “We just extended our season one more game. Sixty-five more plays. I think we got 10 days, or whatever it may be, (until the next game) and every one of them is like gold.”",Sports

"False rape allegations like the Duke scandal aren’t common enough to justify withholding support from victims, advocates say",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/us/duke-lacrosse-rape-case-victims/,"When Katie Koestner was a college freshman, a boy she liked took her out to dinner. They went on a few more dates, she says, until one night, after going back to her college campus dorm, he ignored her pleas and raped her. Up until that point, Koestner was a quiet girl, who rarely spoke out to defend herself when she was mocked or taken advantage of. But this time, she found her voice. The dean of her university, The College of William & Mary in Virginia, steered her away from filing a police report, she says. The man she accused of assaulting her was found guilty in a university investigation but was allowed to stay on campus. For years, Koestner says, she faced backlash for going public with her story. Koestner and other sexual assault victim advocates are now issuing reminders of the dangers of dismissing and discrediting rape allegations in light of thelatest development in the 2006 Duke scandal. Related articleA timeline from accusation to admission: Crystal Mangum says she lied about Duke rape, turning a 2006 scandal on its head More than 18 years after accusing three now-former Duke University lacrosse players of raping her, an account she shared in graphic detail, Crystal Mangum admitted in an interview published Wednesday that she lied about the encounter. Mangum apologized to the men for fabricating a story in which she said she wastrapped inside a bathroom, sexually assaulted and raped by three players at a team party where she was performing as an exotic dancer. The men werearrestedfollowing her allegations. “This was a really damaging instance that hurt those boys’ lives and impacted them for decades, so I don’t want to downplay how tragic it is from that perspective, but I do hope that people put it into context of this is far from the norm,” says Scott Berkowitz, president of non-profit anti-sexual violence organization Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). “For every false report, there is a far greater number of reports both that are truthful and people who experienced rape who never reported. That’s a much bigger national problem.” A study published by the journalViolence Against Womenin 2010 found that false allegations of sexual assault range from between 2% to 10% of assaults reported. A majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63%, are never reported to the police, according to theNational Sexual Violence Resource Center. “Crystal’s case was a high-profile case so many people might hear just about her case and a few others, and then misperceive the amount of false reports to be much higher than it really is,” Koestner, who is now the founder of anti-sexual violence nonprofitTake Back The Night, told CNN. “We should take each case as one situation and not make assumptions about those involved. The Duke case is one of millions. I hear about 10 stories from victims each day I speak at a school — no matter whether it is Princeton or a public high school in Texas.” Rare cases like the Duke scandal, victims’ advocates like Koestner say, might discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and cause people to wrongly doubt them. “False reports hurt not only the people falsely accused, they hurt every rape victim,” Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, vice president of communications for RAINN, told CNN. “There are already too many victims who do not report the crime for fear of not being believed. After a false report in such a high-profile case, even more survivors may be reluctant to come forward out of fear that law enforcement will not believe them.” Survivors of sexual assault and rape often grapple with a range of fears when considering whether to report the crime. Many worry they won’t be believed, that law enforcement won’t take their case seriously, or that their personal history will be used against them. Others are concerned about professional repercussions, having their motives questioned, seeing their reputations tarnished, and losing their privacy. “False reports like this case really exacerbate that problem,” Berkowitz told CNN. Experts say it is crucial for the mental health and recovery of rape victims to feel comfortable reporting their assault and getting help. Victims who have supportive friends and family will have a much better, quicker road to healing, Berkowitz says. The safety of both communities and society as a whole is also dependent on victims reporting their assaults, ensuring that perpetrators are held accountable and prosecuted. “From a justice standpoint, a really significant percentage of rapists are serial criminals, and so when someone reports it and there’s a prosecution, it will statistically better prevent rapes in the future and protect others from being sexually assaulted,” Berkowitz said. Many victims keep the trauma to themselves and don’t even tell those closest to them what happened, which can have a significant long-term impact on their health. Many survivors often struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for years after the assault, Berkowitz said. Rape victims are also significantly more likely to later have drug- and alcohol-related problems and experience mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Rape victims are 13 times more likely than non-crime victims to attempt suicide, according to a study by theNational Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center. “Rape is very similar to other types of trauma and the effects that it has on someone,” Berkowitz said. “It’s not something that anyone ever forgets or completely moves past, but we want to see victims heal to a point where they can continue living their lives and continue to devote the time to family and to work as they as they should be.” Victims can receive mental health support from resources including theNational Sexual Assault hotlineor from professional therapists. Those who have friends and family who believe them and are there for them as they navigate through the recovery process also have better chances at recovery, Berkowitz said. Koestner was 18 when she was on the cover ofTime magazinein 1991 as one of the first women to publicly speak out about being a victim of date rape – sexual assaults in which there was a form of romantic relationship between the victim and assailant. “My assaulter was found guilty in my campus hearing and told not to go in my dorm for a semester as his punishment. It was the lack of accountability that caused me to speak out,” Koestner said. “That led to more interviews and helped me let others know that rape can happen to anyone.” Thousands of students signed a petition alleging she lied. Her car was covered with honey and baby powder, she was voted “the most dangerous man on campus,” and derogatory words were written about her on the walls of some women’s bathrooms on campus – but still, she was not silenced. “Speaking out about what happened helped me turn the trauma into a purpose: raising awareness of any problem is the first step toward prevention,” Koestner said. The College of William & Mary later changed its policy to require school officials to suspend students found guilty of sexual assault. There are more than 433,000 cases of sexual assault or rape annually in the US among people aged 12 and older,according to 2015 data from RAINN. Every 68 seconds, another American is sexually assaulted, RAINN data from 2020 shows. Kaleba said she encourages people to consider the victims of rape or sexual assault in the USwho may now face renewed disbelief and question the value of reporting sexual violence. “Don’t allow infrequent, false reporting to stand in the way of standing with survivors,” Kaleba said.

‘Captain America’ rescued from Colorado highway,https://www.cnn.com/colorado-captain-america-gnojek/,"Sometimes even superheroes need rescuing. A Colorado deputy came to the aid of “Captain America” after the crusader’s motorcycle broke down en route to a local children’s hospital event last Wednesday. Matt Gnojek, dressed as the Avenger and known locally asColorado Captain, had planned to make an appearance at the hospital’s holiday parade when an engine failure left him stranded on the highway shoulder just south of Denver. Enter Douglas County Sheriff’s Deputy Zach Zepeski who came upon Gnojek while out on patrol. “I just wanted him to focus on being safe,” Zepeski told CNN. Gnojek told the deputy his insurance didn’t cover the cost of a tow and mentioned he was in contact with a friend to secure a ride. Intrigued by the costume and Gnojek’s “military-style” motorcycle, Zepeski asked where the superhero was headed. When he learned of Gnojek’s destination,  Zepeski jumped into action. Part of the encounter was caught onbody camera footagereleased by the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. Zepeski offered to pay for the cost of the tow and waited for the truck to arrive ensuring the motorcycle was moved to a safe location while Gnojek and his friend made arrangements to pick up the vehicle. “I’ve been to a couple of those parades for the kids and seeing the smiles on their faces … is just amazing,” Zepeski said. “He is doing this out of the goodness of his heart, he just wants to make people smile, and if I can do anything to help with that, that’s all I needed.” Although Gnojek ultimately missed the parade, he has since participated in several other events, including the “Shop with a Cop” weekend event organized by Zepeski’s sheriff’s office. The event provided lower income children with gift cards to shop for holiday presents. “I couldn’t be more grateful to (Zepeski) – thanks to him I get to go and do all these events and visit the kids and rally more people to the cause,” Gnojek told CNN. Colorado Captain, Gnojek’s superhero persona, raises funds for families battling pediatric cancer through theCap for Kidsorganization. He also visits hospitals, refugee centers and veteran events, Gnojek said. Zepeski’s act of kindness earned praise on social media, with some usersofferingto help cover the towing costs. Zepeski declined those offers. “I hope that rather than paying me back, they donate to (Colorado Captain) or to any sort of children’s fund or charity that they find in their heart they want to donate to,” he said.“I’d much rather have it go to them than to me.”",Society
"Elon Musk endorses far-right German political party, wading deeper into global politics",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/20/media/elon-musk-afd-germany-politics-far-right/,"Elon Musk is wading into more than just American politics, throwing his support behind a far-right German political party. Musk, the billionaire Trump ally who isplaying a public rolein the incoming administration, posted in support Friday of Alternative for Germany, or AfD, after the German government collapsed this week. “Only the AfD can save Germany,” Musk wrote Friday while re-posting a video from far-right political activist Naomi Seibt. The AfD, which has recently seen its popularity swell, has touted populist and anti-immigrant “Germany first” positions. But the party has also been accused of resurrecting Nazi-era ideology and slogans. In May, a judge ruled that Germany’s domestic intelligence agency could continue to keep the the AfD under surveillance for the alleged threat it poses to German democracy, rejecting a challenge by the party. Its youth arm, the Young Alternative (JA), has been designated by German authorities as a “confirmed extremist” organization. The party’s lead candidate in the eastern German state of Thuringia, Björn Höcke, was convicted earlier this year after breaking German laws against uttering Nazi slogans in public. Related articleElon Musk flexes his political muscle, sending government on path to shutdown But the party has seen growing support. AfDrecently becamethe first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since the Nazi era, though all of the country’s mainstream political parties have said they will not sit with them in a coalition, which will be necessary to form enough seats for a ruling government. It’s not the first time Musk has waded into German politics. In June, he responded to a video of Seibt’s asking “Why is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD? They keep saying ‘far right,’ but the policies of AfD that I’ve read about don’t sound extremist. Maybe I’m missing something,” he wrote. And last month he labeled German Chancellor Olaf Scholz a “fool” after his governing coalition collapsed. On Friday, Musk continued posting about the AfD, writing in response to a user’s post about the party’s immigration policy that it “sounds reasonable.” Musk began following AfD leader Alice Weidel on X who responded to his endorsement, posting a video expressing gratitude. “Alternative for Germany is indeed the one and only alternative for our country; our very last option. I wish you and President Donald Trump all the best for the upcoming tenure!” she wrote. Christian Lindner, the leader of Germany’s pro-business Free Democratic Party, also responded to Musk’s post Friday urging him not to “rush to conclusions from afar.” “While migration control is crucial for Germany, the AfD stands against freedom, business – and it’s a far-right extremist party,” Lindner wrote. Musk has increasingly thrown his support behind far-right causes in Europe. Earlier this year,Musk agitatedanti-immigration riots in the UK, writing on his social media platform that “civil war is inevitable” in response to a post blaming the violent demonstrations on the effects of “mass migration and open borders.” Earlier this week, Nigel Farage, the far-right populist British politician and Trump ally, said Musk was considering funding his Reform UK party. Writing in theTelegraph newspaper, Farage said that after meeting with Musk he “left us in no doubt that he is right behind us” and was in “ongoing negotiations” about making a financial contribution.","Politics, World"
A ‘pro-America’ India could help Delhi win over Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/20/india/pro-america-india-modi-trump-intl-hnk/,"United States President-elect Donald Trump is staying true to his self-given moniker of “tariff man.” This time, he’s taking aim at some of the world’s fastest-growing major economies in the weeks before his inauguration. Earlier this month, he singled out the BRICS nations,threatening them with 100% tariffsif they form a new currency or replace the US dollar with a different tender altogether. India, a founding BRICS member, is powerful and central to the intergovernmental organization, that also features China and Russia among others. Like other countries, India has been targeted by Trump, who called New Delhi a “very big abuser” of the bilateral trading relationship during a campaign event in September. Even during his first administration, Trump applied tariffs on steel and aluminum that set off a cascade of retaliatory moves. He eventually also stripped the country of preferential trade status, removing a designation that exempted billions of dollars’s worth of the country’s products from US tariffs and igniting anger among Indian officials. But despite all that, the president-elect enjoys a warm personal relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two men praised each other enthusiastically four years ago, when the president visited Modi’s home state of Gujarat. Observers say that rapport is likely to serve India well during Trump’s second term. The other original BRICS members – Russia, China and Brazil – are known to be “anti-American in sentiment,” Harsh Pant, vice president of the Observer Research Foundation in the Indian capital, told CNN. “India remains one country which is not.” New Delhi is an outlier within the group and that could put it in an advantageous position, particularly given its heft, to quash any talk of de-dollarization, he said. The idea, along-held ambitionfor some members, could in theory see the group move away from using the greenback and seek to build either a new currency or transition to another tender altogether. Using other currenciescould allowmember countries to reduce their dependence on the US dollar. “Having Trump breathing down BRICS’ neck saying, ‘don’t go down that road,’ gives India more space to maneuver,” Pant added. It allows India to say the group should tread carefully to avoid provoking a very reactive United States, Pant said. India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said this month that India had no interest in weakening the US dollar. There is still considersable pro-Washington sentiment in the Indian capital. China, and the belief that the US is on a collision course with the Asian superpower, is driving the relationship between Washington and India, according to some observers. “His first term was quite positive, and the relationship that he ended up having with Modi also worked well for India, and therefore there is a sense that the second term might not be as disruptive,” Pant said. Modi and Trump burnished their personal ties during Trump’s first term. Modi was feted at a rally in Texas in September 2019 titled “Howdy Modi.” The favor was returned for President Trump in February 2020 when 125,000 people turned out for the “Namaste Trump” rally in Ahmedabad. Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center’s South Asian Institute in Annapolis, Maryland also believes that an incoming Trump administration may afford India some rapprochement compared with the Biden years, particularly over issues like Ukraine and human rights. “The world views of Trump and Modi are much closer, they converge a lot more than the world views of Biden/Obama and Modi,” he said. On Ukraine, he added, neither Trump nor Modi has criticized President Vladimir Putin for the invasion in 2022 and both have recently called for peace. Trump has said he would end the war in 24 hours, and Modi offered his help to broker peace when he visited Moscow in July. Yet that is not likely to totally absolve India from the occasional turbulence associated with a Trump administration. A universal tariff of 10% threated by Trump would impact India, Kugelman said, in part because India enjoys a trade surplus with the US. Trade between the two sides has heavily favored New Delhi, according toUnited States data. Over the past two years, the US has imported about twice as much as it has exported. India is becoming an increasingly important manufacturing hub for companies such as Apple, especially as it seeks to build its supply chains outside China. In the first 10 months of this year, the US has imported $73 billion from India, compared with the $35 billion it has exported to the country. Kugelman and Pant agree that the trade imbalance would create headaches for New Delhi, but not ones that are insurmountable. Instead, it might make discussions about deals or policy more transactional. “This is just how Trump rolls, so even strategic partners like New Delhi will have to adjust to that,” said Kugelman. Trump is “a deal maker,” said Pant. “It’s always about give and take. So, the long-term approach to policy making has to give way to more ad hoc approaches … what’s the deal you can cut now, rather than looking five years down the line.” Pant points to a 2018 waiver given to New Delhi by Washington over the Chabahar Port in Iran. The exemption was needed following the reimposition of sanctions on Iran. The restrictions forced all US companies, foreign firms and countries from doing business with Iran. New Delhi had signed a 10-year, $500 billion agreement with Tehran to run and operate the port, which India sees as a vital trade route to Central Asia and Afghanistan bypassing its archrival Pakistan. The waiver formed part of Donald Trump’s then South Asia policy. In a 2017 speech, he called on India to assist the US with more economic help to Afghanistan. He used highly beneficial trade between the two as a bargaining chip. “If you are able to put your interests transparently, and if you’re able to do business with him, then you may not be as worse off,” Pant added. India has demonstrated it is able to walk the fine line between staying on the good side of Trump while also pursuing its own interests. Time will tell if that can be replicated, but the view from New Delhi appears to be optimistic.","Politics, World"
Missouri governor commutes sentence of White police officer convicted of fatally shooting Black man,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/us/missouri-eric-devalkenaere-sentence-commuted/,"A White former Kansas City police officer who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a Black man was released from prison Friday after Missouri’s governor commuted his sentence to parole. The decision by Republican Gov. Mike Parson to free Eric DeValkenaere came after months of public debate about the case, which had fueled both racial justice protests and impassioned pleas for mercy from DeValkenaere’s supporters who asserted he had been unjustly convicted. DeValkenaere wasserving a six-year prison sentence.He wasconvicted in 2021of killing 26-year-old Cameron Lamb as he backed into his garage. Lamb’s name was invoked frequently during racial injustice protests in Kansas City in 2020 following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Lamb’s family even met with then-President Donald Trump that year. Parson did not pardon DeValkenaere but rather shortened his sentence to parole, subject to normal restrictions against possessing firearms, traveling out of state without permission and other items. He granted a similar commutation of parole to Patty Prewitt, another high-profile prisoner who had spent 40 years behind bars for her husband’s killing. The Department of Corrections confirmed both were freed Friday afternoon, before Parson publicly announced his decisions. DeValkenaere had been held in an out-of-state prison for his own safety, said Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann. Jason Johnson, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, which supports DeValkenaere, said they “will continue to fight to completely clear” his name. Johnson said in a statement that DeValkenaere had an outstanding record of service, adding: “While we strongly maintain that Eric is completely innocent, even those who do not must recognize that the ends of justice are not served by his incarceration.” The clemency announcements came just weeks before Parson is to end his term, capping a historic string of such actions. Parson, a former rural sheriff, has pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 800 people while clearing a backlog of more than 3,500 clemency requests he inherited upon taking office in June 2018. That’s themost granted clemency casesof any Missouri governor since the 1940s. Most granted clemency had been convicted of lower-level crimes involving drugs or theft. But Parson also denied more than 3,000 clemency petitions. Gwendolyn Grant, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City, said the DeValkenaere clemency decision will tarnish Parson’s legacy and “will fuel deeper divisions and ignite justified outrage.” Grant called Parson’s decision “nothing short of a flagrant endorsement of systemic racism and a betrayal of justice.” “By freeing a convicted officer who unlawfully killed Cameron Lamb, a young Black man, the governor has made it crystal clear that Black lives do not matter in the state of Missouri under his leadership,” Grant said. At trial, DeValkenaere testified that he fired his weapon on Dec. 3, 2019, after Lamb pointed a gun at another detective, Troy Schwalm, and that he believed his actions saved his partner’s life. Prosecutors, however, argued that police shouldn’t have been on the property and staged the shooting scene to support their claims that Lamb was armed. “DeValkenaere was convicted for killing an unarmed man. Period,” Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said in a social media post Friday. “He was shown incredible mercy by the Governor. No such mercy was shown to the victims. Today we will focus our time caring for Cameron’s family rather than commenting further.” Messages left with attorneys for the Lamb family were not immediately returned Friday. Evidence presented during the trial, which was held without a jury at DeValkenaere’s request, showed DeValkenaere kicked over a barricade to get into Lamb’s backyard. The trial judge, Dale Youngs, said the officers had no warrant for Lamb’s arrest and had no search warrant or consent to be on the property. He called it a tragic case with troubling facts and said DeValkenaere and the officer with him escalated a situation that had been calmed. He didn’t address allegations that evidence had been planted. DeValkenaereleft the police force after his convictionbut remained free on bond until helost his appealin October 2023. The Missouri Supreme Court subsequentlydeclinedto hear an appeal. DeValkenaere’s wife, Sarah DeValkenaere, took to social media earlier this week — as she had done often — urging followers to request a pardon. “I miss him so much,” she said in amessageon X in November. “So sad that an officer who dedicated his life to serving our city is now in prison for doing his job.” Parson did not offer an explanation for his clemency decisions while announcing them Friday. But he had previously acknowledged the pressure in an interview in August on KCMO Talk Radio. “There’s not a week that goes by that somebody’s not reaching out to me about that issue, and we’re going to see what happens here before long. I’ll leave it at that. But you know, I don’t like where he’s at. I’ll just say that,” Parson said. Prewitt, now 75, had filed multiple clemency requests over the years. She was serving a life sentence after being convicted of fatally shooting her husband, Bill Prewitt, in 1984 as he slept in their home in the rural east-central Missouri town of Holden. Prewitt, a mother of five, said a stranger broke into the house. She declined a plea deal that would have given her the chance for parole after five to seven years. Prosecutors said Prewitt cheated on her husband and her ex-lovers testified at trial in 1985 that she had talked about killing Bill Prewitt. But Patty Prewitt’s backers argued that her relationship with her husband was improving and that the evidence of her infidelity would not be allowed in court today. In addition, Georgetown University law students examining the case found prosecutors failed to tell defense attorneys that two days after Prewitt’s husband was killed, a neighbor told investigators she had seen a man parked at the end of a nearby dirt road in heavy rain on the night of the murder.",Society
"In the summer of 1979, he made a decision that went against what polls said most Americans wanted",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/politics/jimmy-carter-refugees-legacy-cec/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story published last year after President Carter entered hospice care. Steps thatJimmy Cartertook during his presidency are still shaping the United States, decades after he left office. But they didn’t help him at the polls. Because of Carter’s actions, hundreds of thousands of people fleeing persecution had a chance to come to the United States when he was commander-in-chief. And millions more resettled in the US after he left office. “He was well aware of the political cost,” says Carter biographer Kai Bird, author of “The Outlier: The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter.” When it came to taking on tough issues, Bird says, Carter didn’t shy away from doing what he thought was right. And that’s where Carter found himself in the summer of 1979, making a decision that went against what polls said that most Americans wanted. The scenes from the other side of the world were devastating. Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing government oppression in Southeast Asia were taking to the sea, and many were drowning as they tried to escape. A crisis that began before Carter took office was becoming increasingly dire by the day. In 1978, Carter ordered American ships to pick up refugees fleeing by boat. A year later, the exodus had only intensified. And as world leaders met to discuss top issues facing their countries, Carter took a dramatic stand, announcing the US would double the number of refugees accepted monthly from the region from 7,000 to 14,000. The move, according to news reports at the time, was aimed at pushing other countries to take similarly significant steps. It was not politically popular. As writer Thu-Huong Ha noted in a 2016 piece for Quartz, a poll from CBS and The New York Times showed that 62% of Americans disapproved. And a Gallup poll indicated 57% of Americans were opposed to the US relaxing its immigration policies for refugees from the region. Carter did it anyway. “We are prepared to act with the compassion that has traditionally characterized the United States when confronted with such situations of human crisis,” Carter said in a statement released by the White House as he announced the new policy. “Thousands of human lives are at stake.” Bee Nguyen says it’s something her family never forgot. “My mom is what you would consider apolitical. My father is conservative. … (President Carter) was the one political person that both my parents spoke about with respect and fondness, and still do to this day,” says Nguyen, a former Georgia state representative. That respect, Nguyen says, was earned by actions that Carter took that changed the course of her parents’ lives. Nguyen says her parents fled Vietnam by boat in 1978. A Thai fisherman rescued them, she says, and they spent months in refugee camps in Thailand. “My parents, they risked their lives. They left a country in which they experienced the loss of civil liberties, in which my father was incarcerated by his own government. And they were in search of freedom,” Nguyen says. They found it in Iowa, where they moved in 1979. “They were only able to do so because of the political courage exercised by President Carter,” she says. As#AAPIHeritageMonthcomes to a close, I honor every day: my father – he served in the Vietnamese army, was imprisoned by his government & built a life in America as an engineer & pharmacist. My mother – she helped facilitate her family's escape by boat & raised 5 daughters. ♥️pic.twitter.com/VZa8vYxQIj Nguyen was born a few years later, and she says what she heard about Carter growing up – and about Iowa’s then-governor, Republican Robert Ray, who also made a point of welcoming refugees – shaped her own views about America. To Nguyen, the stand Carter and other politicians took is just as important today as it was when her parents first arrived. Over the years, Americans’ views on their responsibilities toward refugees have fluctuated. In 2022, 72% of Americans said taking in refugees from countries where people are trying to escape violence and war should be a very or somewhat important goal for US immigration policy, according to a Pew Research Centersurvey, but opinions varied widely by party, race and ethnicity. “It’s important for us to learn as a country, to remember and understand that we as a nation from a values perspective and by law … we promised as a nation to be a safe harbor for people who are fleeing, for people whose lives are in danger,” she says. Carter’s fateful decision that summer of 1979 wasn’t the only step he took in that direction. On the frigid day when Faith Akovi Cooper first set foot in the United States with her mother and siblings, Carter was no longer in office. But she says she sees a direct connection between the former US president and the life she’s led since that day in January 1993. Back then, she was a refugee who’d fled war in Liberia. And thanks to a law Carter signed, the Refugee Act of 1980, her family was able to move to Reston, Virginia. The law, signed by President Carter in March 1980, created the framework that’s used to help those fleeing persecution around the world seek a better life in the United States. “My family is here today as a result of that act,” Cooper says. And now, as the International Rescue Committee’s regional director for resettlement, asylum and integration in the Southern US border region, she says she’s even more aware of how vast the law’s impact has been. “Millions of people have had the chance to rebuild their lives in the United States,” Cooper says. She was one of them. Rebuilding her life in the US included pursuing a career in global health and eventually going on to work for a leading refugee resettlement organization. More than 3 million refugees have come to the United States since 1980, including such well-known figures as actor Mila Kunis, singer Regina Spektor and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Millions are taxpaying Americans who have contributed greatly to our communities and to our economy,” Carter said in a 2021 statement commemorating the act’s anniversary. More than 125,000 refugees from Southeast Asia had fled to the US in the immediate aftermath of Saigon’s fall, and even more would come during Carter’s presidency. While fewer refugees came to the US annually after Carter left office, the country’s refugee resettlement program created by the 1980 act became a sought-after pathway. The law officially defined a refugee as someone with a “well-founded fear of persecution,” nearly tripled the number refugees the United States would accept and created a process for adjusting that number in emergencies. “Desperate refugees were drowning and dying from exposure at our doorstep, yet the United States lacked a legal structure to receive them in an orderly way,” Carter said in 2021. While Carter’s earlier move to welcome more refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos wasn’t politically popular, the Refugee Act sailed to approval in Congress with nearly unanimous support. “This was a humanitarian crisis, which Republicans and Democrats agreed on. And even in the midst of a very bitter primary campaign … we were still able to cooperate, because the problem was so massive and so important,” Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser during his presidency, recalled in a 2019 interview with HIAS. But it wasn’t long before Carter would once again find himself making an unpopular decision. “We were challenged almost immediately, when the act was hardly dry, with crises that were not anticipated,” Eizenstat said in the 2019 HIAS interview. One of the most significant ones unfolded less than 100 miles from America’s shores. In April 1980, Cuban President Fidel Castro proclaimed that any Cuban citizen who wanted to emigrate to the United States could do so. The catch? They had to depart from the port of Mariel, about 30 miles from Havana. And they had to have arranged for someone on a boat to pick them up and take them to Florida. A few weeks later, addressing the League of Women Voters national convention in Miami, Carter noted that the US was a “country of refugees” that would “continue to provide an open heart and open arms” to those fleeing Cuba. The operation became known as the Mariel boatlift. Carter referred to the boats as “freedom flotillas.” But media coverage of those escaping oppression for the chance at a better life was quickly drowned out by reports claiming that Castro had also taken the opportunity to empty jails and mental institutions. In an interview with CNN on the network’s first day broadcasting, June 1, 1980, Carter faced questions over a Cuban refugee uprising at an Arkansas resettlement center, where buildings were set ablaze and hostages were taken. Several thousand hardened criminals did make their way to the United States during that exodus of 125,000 people, says José Manuel García, an associate professor of Hispanic literature and Latin American studies at Florida Southern College. It was a small fraction of the group, says García, who was part of the boatlift himself and has written a book and worked on a documentary sharing the experiences of others who made the journey. García was 13 years old when he left Cuba with his family. And he says many Cubans who made that same journey went on to build successful businesses and media careers in the United States. But the bad reputation of the Cubans known as Marielitos firmly took root, even getting a mention in the opening of the 1983 movie “Scarface.” “Even years later, 40 years later, whenever I tell somebody…the first thing that pops in their mind is, ‘You came with those criminals.’ That is the image that has persisted,” García says. Carter, who was running for a second term, eventually shifted his stance on the boatlift. Washington and Havana agreed it would end just days before the 1980 election. Analysts argued Carter’s handling of the crisis was a factor contributing to his loss to Ronald Reagan. Beyond the 1980 presidential vote, there was likely another longer-term cost for Democrats, biographer Bird notes. The boatlift played a role in bolstering South Florida’s conservative political landscape, he says, as many Cubans who fled Castro’s communist regime ended up voting Republican once they became US citizens. Among more conservative Cuban Americans, Carter is not a popular figure, García says. Many saw his handling of the boatlift as weak, and felt he was easily manipulated by Castro. But García says he sees Carter’s legacy differently. “He was a humanitarian. And this is somebody whose primary goal was, ‘We’re going to help these poor people who are escaping communism. They want a better life, and we’re going to do whatever we can to support them,’” he says. “I’ve had all these opportunities because of the fact that the Mariel boatlift happened … and President Carter was willing to help us come to the United States.” Carter’s actions may have cost him reelection, but García says they gave him — and so many others — a chance to live the lives they’d dreamed of having.",Politics
Carter leaves an incomparable judicial legacy,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/politics/jimmy-carter-supreme-court-legacy/,"Jimmy Carter, who served a single full presidential term without the chance to appoint a Supreme Court justice, nonetheless left behind an incomparable judicial legacy. He was the first president to significantly diversify the lower federal courts by appointing female and minority judges — a point that the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg often touted. Carter named Ginsburg to an important Washington-based US Court of Appeals in 1980, which positioned her for eventual elevation to the Supreme Court. His presidency was the first during which women made up a significant number of confirmed circuit and district court nominees, according to a Congressional Research Service compilation of judicial appointments. During his one-term presidency, 41 of his appointees were women. Women made up 12 of his 59 circuit court appointees and 29 of his total 203 district court appointees. Until Carter’s tenure, only two women had ever been named as circuit court judges and six as district court judges. “Once Carter appointed women to the bench in numbers, there was no turning back,” Ginsburg, who died in 2020, declared inone speech. Recounting the earlier resistance to women on the bench, Ginsburg added that when former President Harry Truman, who served from 1945 to 1953, broached the possibility of a woman on the court, justices reportedly said a woman justice “would make it difficult for (the other justices) to meet informally with robes, and perhaps shoes, off, shirt collars unbuttoned and discuss their problems and come to decisions.” In addition to the 41 women judges Carter named to the federal judiciary, he appointed a record 57 people of color to the bench, including those who would become prominent federal appellate judges such as Leon Higginbotham, on the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit; Amalya Kearse, on the New York-based 2nd Circuit; and Damon Keith on the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit. Civil rights advocates praised Carter’s work for bringing diversity to the bench. But it was also in the words of Sherrilyn Ifill, Howard University law professor and former NAACP Legal Defense Fund director, “important for improving the legitimacy and quality of judging.” Carter downplayed his role in the barrier-breaking pattern,saying, “The nation was ready for it.” Yet, Carter never garnered the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. He is the only one-term president who finished a full term without an appointment. His emphasis on appointing female and minority judges, however, may have added to the pressure on Ronald Reagan when he was running against Carter in 1980 to vow to appoint the first woman to the Supreme Court. Reagan made the vow in October 1980, telling an audience in Los Angeles, “One of the first Supreme Court vacancies in my administration will be filled by the most qualified woman I can find.” At the time, Carter dismissed the promise as a cynical ploy for votes, saying, “Equal rights for women involves more than just one job for one woman.” A few months after Reagan claimed the White House in 1981, he made good on his promise and nominated Sandra Day O’Connor. The second woman, named by President Bill Clinton in 1993, was Ginsburg, Carter’s earlier appellate court choice.",Politics
Federal appeals court upholds sexual abuse verdict against Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/politics/federal-appeals-court-upholds-sexual-abuse-case-against-trump/,"A federal appeals court upheld the jury’s verdict finding Donald Trumpsexually abused writer E. Jean Carrolland denied his request for a new trial. Trump challenged the $5 million civil verdict alleging the trial judge made numerous errors, including allowing testimony of two other women who claimed Trump sexually assaulted them. The appeals court concluded the trial judge didn’t abuse his discretion in ruling on evidence. Even if he made any errors, they said, given the strength of Carroll’s case, they are not persuaded Trump’s rights were affected to warrant a new trial. “Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today’s decision. We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties’ arguments,” said Roberta Kaplan, Carroll’s attorney. A separate jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million after finding Trump defamed her by denying the sexual abuse. Trump has also appealed that verdict. Carroll alleged Trump raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. Trump denied all wrongdoing. He does not face any jail time as a result of the civil verdict. While the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her. Carroll filed the lawsuit last year under the “New York State Adult Survivors Act,” a state bill which opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitation. Steven Cheung – Trump’s top spokesman and incoming White House communications director – said more appeals are coming. “The American People have re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed. We look forward to uniting our country in the new administration as President Trump makes America great again,” Cheung said. CNN’s Lauren Del Valle contributed to this report.",Politics
Trump endorses Johnson in speaker’s race,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/politics/trump-endorses-johnson-in-speakers-race/,"President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that Speaker Mike Johnson has his “complete” and “total” endorsement, a major boost for the top House Republican ahead of a critical vote this week. Trump’s endorsement comes as some House conservatives have warned they are not committed to backing Johnson in the speaker’s race. The President-elect’s endorsement could help Johnson lock down the votes he will need, especially after he navigated a chaotic government funding fight earlier this month that drew the ire of some members of his right flank. But Johnson faces an extraordinary narrow margin and can only lose a single Republican vote to still win the gavel, leaving little room for error. One House Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, has already said he doesn’t plan to vote for Johnson, and the Kentucky Republicans told CNN on Monday that Trump’s endorsement does not change his position. Members had been preparing for a Trump endorsement, one source told CNN. But the same source warned that it may not be enough. Johnson allies are keeping close tabs on members who have not committed to backing him yet, including Rep. Victoria Spartz. The source told CNN that Spartz is viewed as unpredictable and that there are “also six or seven other members” who similarly remain wildcards. Over the last several weeks, Johnson’s deputies have launched an expansive whip operation, but there are still intense challenges to getting Johnson to 218 votes – the magic number needed to win the gavel. One Republican member familiar with the outreach told CNN that while the vast majority of GOP members understand how “monumentally stupid” it could be to have an extensive speaker’s battle, not every member is swayed by an argument that the party needs to be united going into the inauguration. “A vast majority of Republicans are rational, but not every member of the Republican conference is rational,” the member lamented. Trump praised Johnson on Monday, saying he is “hard working” and “will do the right thing.” “The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. After Johnson cut a deal with Democrats over spending in mid-December, Trump injected a last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling that left Johnson grasping for a plan B. A revised GOP plan ultimately failed to get enough Republican votes to pass and caused grumbling among Johnson’s right flank that the speaker wasn’t up to the job. It also caused some to wonder if Trump would stick with Johnson ahead of the speaker fight. Massie said earlier this month that he did not plan to back Johnson in the speaker’s race. In response to Trump’s endorsement, Massie wrote on X, “I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan. We’ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget.” Separately, a CNN tally of members prior to Trump’s endorsement found that nearly a dozen others had not yet committed to Johnson. Johnson will face a vote on the House floor on Friday when the new Congress convenes. Another challenge is that so far the House Freedom Caucus, which includes some of the members who are most weary of reelecting Johnson, has not come out with a unified list of demands creating a situation where every single member is acting a bit as a free agent. For some members, there are concerns about how the party will begin to pass individual spending bills again that address reducing the country’s debt and deficit. That could be difficult given that House Republicans have shown repeatedly they don’t have the votes to pass all 12 spending bills with just GOP votes. Not to mention the fact that Republicans will continue to need Democratic votes even in a Trump administration to keep the government funded given that Republicans don’t have the 60 votes needed in the Senate to pass bills on their own. Johnson is also telling people that he is not open to reducing the number of members it would take to force a vote to oust a speaker after the GOP conference agreed to raise the threshold. As part of a conference-wide negotiation in November, Republicans decided to increase the number of members it would take to force a vote on what is known as the motion to vacate from one member to nine. A source familiar with Johnson’s thinking says that the speaker does not believe that he can reverse course on what he sees as a conference-negotiated position. When former Speaker Kevin McCarthy went 15 rounds to get the speaker’s gavel in 2023, he eventually acquiesced to conservative demands to lower the threshold for the motion to vacate to a single member, a move that ultimately led to his ouster.

What the visa feud says about the coming Trump administration,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/politics/trump-musk-h1b-visa-analysis/,"Donald Trump’ssiding with Elon Muskover visas for high-tech workers is the most significant example yet of the president-elect favoring powerful elements in his new MAGA coalition over his base’s anti-immigrant DNA that he twice tapped in his rise to power. The boiling holidayfeud over H-1B visasexposed new fissures across Trump’s broadened support base and reflected the contradictions between his populist ideology and the self-interests of many of the key players in his refashioned inner circle. After several days of silence over the controversy, the president-elect stepped in, making clear he supported Musk’s argument for recruitment flexibility for the tech industry. Related articleTrump defends foreign worker visas, siding with Musk amid MAGA backlash Musk, the richest man in the world, made his case in a series of outspoken posts on X. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,” he wrote to one critic on the platform that he owns. “I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.” The visa issue erupted into a full-blown storm following comments by Vivek Ramaswamy, Musk’s co-chair ofthe Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump has set up to slash the size of federal operations. The former GOP presidential candidate criticized American culture, education standards and children’s TV that he said “venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.” The comments came perilously close to an elitist’s disdain for millions of Americans and their culture that Republicans have long accused Democrats of promoting. On the other side of the debate, Steve Bannon, who served in the first Trump administration, blasted H-1B visas on his “War Room” podcast as a “scam” by Silicon Valley oligarchs that are about “taking American jobs and bringing over what essentially become indentured servants at lower wages.” H-1B visas allow the brightest foreign workers, many of them engineers and computer scientists, to live and work in the US. Supporters say they’re vital to ensuring Silicon Valley innovation continues to lead the world.  The issue has become broader than a mere economic question: because of artificial intelligence and new generation computing, the industry is now critical to US defense and national security. But some of Trump’s most vocal and committed MAGA supporters have blasted the visas as inconsistent with the America First and anti-immigration philosophy on which the president-elect built his appeal. Some critics of the system also argue that by importing foreign workers, the US government blocks the path to advancement for American workers and college graduates, including minorities. One case is insufficient evidence to judge whether Trump’s favoring of the Tesla and SpaceX pioneer will set the tone for a presidency over whichMusk already holdsconsiderable sway. And Trump defies patterns by acting on his gut and keeping opponents off-balance, so it would be risky to see the H1-B visa issue as a wider metaphor for how the administration will unfold. However, Musk’s capacity to use X to spread his message, as well as Trump’s eventual blessing for his argument, underscores the huge power he commands as the ubiquitous but unelected sidekick of the president-elect. Earlier this month, for example, Musk came out ahead of Trump and used his platform tohelp tank a bipartisan funding billin the House, sending the government perilously close to a shutdown. His influence could have implications beyond immigration policy. Musk’s vast business before the US government — across multiple sectors of the space industry, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence — could quickly cause multiple conflicts of interest. And he has enormous sway abroad — including in countries like China, where the hawkish views of some of Trump’s top Cabinet picks also risk colliding with the tech mogul’s priorities. H-1B nonimmigrant visas allow American firms to temporarily employ foreign workers with specialized knowledge and advanced academic qualifications to help them stay globally competitive. Proponents say the system is not intended to replace American workers but to fill vital gaps for specialized workers that the US workforce cannot satisfy. The visas have often been used by South Asian workers nurtured in India’s thriving high-tech industries to come to the United States and build a prosperous diaspora. In isolation, attempts to expand the H-1B visa program would not seem incompatible with Trump’shardline immigration policyand promise of a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants to begin soon after he’s sworn in next month. But nearly two decades of bipartisan attempts to overhaul and solidify the H-1B program have largely failed, often as broad immigration reform plans foundered on the polarization of immigration politics that Trump used to fuel his rise to power in 2016 and again in 2024. Related articleTrump vows to ‘hire American.’ His businesses keep hiring foreign guest workers Trump has now made clear he agrees with Musk and said he’d sometimes usedH-1Bvisas in his businesses, although he’smore frequently employedtemporary part-time foreign workers on H-2B visas at his golf resorts and hotels. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump told The New York Post on Saturday about the H-1B system. Musk made the case for expanding the program in one of his less explosive posts on X. “We should greatly increase legal immigration of anyone who is hard-working, honest and loves America,” he wrote. “Every such person is an asset to the country. But massive illegal immigration of people we know nothing about is insane.” Supporters of the South Africa-born immigrant argue that his success in disrupting and reinventing industries like space exploration and low-carbon transportation mean he’s exactly the kind of person who should be at the center of government, innovating in Washington. But the tech mogul also has clear self-interests in remaining close to the next president, given his billions of dollars in contracts with the US government. And his new position at DOGE ostensibly gives him the capacity to slash regulations that constrain his own ventures. Musk’s zeal for defending H-1B visas appears to be a signal that he will not shirk from aggressively pushing his agenda when Trump is president. It will be up to the president-elect to decidehow he responds. Liberal social media pundits delighted in highlighting a “civil war” in the MAGA movement. But there’s nothing necessarily new about a president presiding over feuding parties in his coalition. Trump, for instance, often seems to invite conflict among his aides. And even PresidentJoe Bidenhad to manage antagonism between the progressive and more moderate wings of the Democratic Party early in his administration. In the coming weeks, Trump’s ability to reconcile the differing interests among conservative budget hawks, hardline MAGA lawmakers and comparative moderates who may be vulnerable in 2026 general elections will dictate the fate of his aggressive legislative plans on immigration, budget trimming and tax cuts. Related articleTrump bristles at Musk’s rocketing profile as Democrats play on the president-elect’s vanity But there’s no modern precedent for a faction of a president’s power base being led by someone as rich, mercurial and powerful as Musk with immediate access to a mighty social media network. Republican lawmakers, for instance, spoke before Christmas about how the phones in their offices suddenly lit up when Musk called for the gutting of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s initial year-end spending bill. And the Tesla chief’s advocacy for the lucrative high-tech industry on the West Coast feels a million miles away from the economic concerns expressed by Trump’s core supporters and the low-propensity voters in the suburbs who paved his way back to the White House. The president-elect ran on reducing the price of eggs and bacon after a punishing round of inflation — yet he’s largelychosen a Cabinetofbillionaires and millionaireswho’ve not had to worry about such matters for years. If Trump’s Cabinet secretaries are as zealous in pursuing their personal goals as Musk is, his administration’s policy may appear inconsistent and out of touch. The uproar over tech visas also revived one of the transition’s most intriguing questions. How long will Trump tolerate Musk’s capacity to dominate political debate in a way that only he can match? Skeptics are convinced that the president-elect will soon tire of Musk’s ubiquity. Democrats have already tried to fracture their relationship by referring to “President Musk.” And the lesson of Trump’s first term is that those who overshadow him soon find themselves exiting his orbit or becoming a scapegoat when things go wrong. This may be how things develop. But both Trump and Musk have huge incentives to stick together. Musk will never be able to replicate the inside government perch that he can use to promote his interests. And Republicans will be banking on the SpaceX chief’s financial might as the midterm elections approach after hepoured tens of millionsof dollars into Trump’s 2024 campaign. But a deeper reality may postpone a possible schism between Trump and Musk. Each has the capacity to wreak destruction on the other. The president-elect will soon be able to wield the federal government as an instrument of revenge. But someone as social media savvy as Trump, who’s spun falsehoods into a reality to which millions of Americans are committed, would surely balk at making an enemy of the man who controls X.","Politics, Business"
Officer says decisions that led to end of Georgia school shooting must have been guided by God,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/us/apalachee-high-school-officer-church-interview-hnk/,"School resource officers Chase Boyd and Brandon Kingsprinted towardthe sound of gunfire inside Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, navigating the disorienting echoes of shots that felt far removed from their training. Before them would be a half-minute of chaos – and split-second, life-or-death decisions – that, in retrospect, must have been guided by God, Boyd said in an interview posted online Sunday. Four people – two students and two teachers – were killed in the school on September 4. Seven others were injured. A Georgia grand juryindictedaccused shooter Colt Gray, 14, on 55 charges, including four counts of felony and malice murder. His father, Colin Gray, was indicted on 29 counts, including two counts of second-degree murder. The indictment alleged Colin Gray gave his son “access to a firearm and ammunition after receiving sufficient warning that Colt Gray would endanger the bodily safety of another.”Bothhavepleadednot guilty. When Boyd and King heard gunshots in the school, they raced toward a smoke-filled hallway, propelled by instinct. “We didn’t have a whole lot of information, but … then all of a sudden we hear gunshots, and we both kind of looked at each other for that split second,” Boyd said in aninterviewwith River Hills Church, a community-focused Christian church in Winder, a community of 19,000 residents about 50 miles east of Atlanta. Related article‘We did what God put us here to do.’ School resource officers describe response to deadly shooting The sounds were disorienting. “It didn’t quite sound like what we would expect a gunshot to sound like inside a building,” Boyd said. As he and King navigated the hallway, Boyd communicated their situation over a radio: “We’ve got an active shooter at Apalachee High School.” When they reached a hallway intersection, Boyd described encountering a black silhouette obscured by smoke and dust. “We can’t shoot because we don’t know if it’s a teacher, a student, the shooter. We have no idea what’s at the end of that hall,” Boyd said in the interview. “We start yelling some things that I’m not going to repeat,” he said, as he described telling the silhouette to get on the ground. The figure quickly complied and Boyd heard a clack sound. He assumed a gun had been dropped. On the ground near the person now lying face-down was an assault-style rifle and what Boyd initially thought was a duffel bag. It turned out to be a victim. “There was nothing we could do for him, unfortunately,” Boyd said in the interview. The officers quickly got the shooter handcuffed, Boyd said. But he didn’t say quiet. “He loses his mind in the handcuffs and tries to get up and starts cussing and being aggressive,” Boyd said. If the shooter had shown that intensity when they first confronted him, Boyd said, an awful tragedy could’ve been much worse. “There was no reason for him to stop shooting at all. Had he just opened fire into that hallway at us, he could have killed us,” Boyd said, noting the shooter had the ammunition to do so. “I took several full magazines of ammunition out of his pockets like he wasn’t done,” Boyd recalled. And then he reflected on the carnage that ammunition could have created. “The shooter walked around the cafeteria that morning … There were 130-some-odd kids if not more in that cafeteria,” he said. Why he didn’t open fire in that cafeteria – or fire on himself and King in that hallway intersection – it had to be a “God thing,” Boyd said. And that may have saved the shooter’s life, too, he said. “The shooter lived because we couldn’t see him. By the time we got to him he was no longer a threat,” Boyd said. “Because he wasn’t a threat, we can’t just execute him.” CNN’s Dakin Andone contributed to this report.",Society
Washington Commanders safety Jeremy Reaves proposes to girlfriend after team reaches first playoff berth since 2020,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/sport/jayden-daniels-commanders-falcons-spt/,"It was a successful night for Washington Commanders safety Jeremy Reaves, for more reasons than one. After helping his team to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2020, Reaves then got down on one knee to propose to his long-term girlfriend Mikaela Worley. The moment came after the Washington Commanders secured a dramatic 30-24 overtime win at home against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday Night Football. With the Northwest Stadium crowd celebrating the win, Reaves helped Worley down from the stands, before popping the question at the side of the field. Morley sunk to her haunches, tears flowing, before saying, “Yes.” The pair then embraced as teammates ran over the celebrate with the happy couple. “Glad we got to share that moment with the best fans in the world!” Reevespostedon X, formerly known as Twitter, after the game. It was the perfect ending to a brilliant night for the Commanders, who were superbly led by rookie quarterbackJayden Daniels. Daniels, who was the second overall pick in this year’s NFL draft and aHeisman winner while at LSU, found tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning touchdown as the Commanders offense did not allow the Falcons to get an offensive possession in the overtime period. JAYDEN TO ZACH SENDS US TO THE POSTSEASON It wasn’t a straightforward game for the young Commanders squad as both teams went back-and-forth trading scores. For the second week in a row, the 24-year-old Daniels had to lead Washington to a come from behind win after the Commanders found themselves down 17-7 at halftime. Washington whittled away at the deficit until a two-yard rushing touchdown from Chris Rodriguez early in the fourth gave the team the lead for the first time since the game’s early going. However, the story of the contest was the battle between Daniels and fellow rookieMichael Penix Jr. Related articleJayden Daniels: The NFL’s No. 2 overall pick is showing the league that he’s much more than a consolation prize The 24-year-old Penix Jr., making his second career start, found tight end Kyle Pitts to tie the game at 24-24 with just over a minute left in the fourth quarter. The Atlanta QB was selected in the 2024 NFL Draft six picks after Daniels and both found themselves fighting to keep their respective teams alive in the playoff race in the last two weeks of the campaign. Despite throwing an interception on his first possession of the game, Penix Jr. rebounded, finishing with 223 yards and a touchdown. Daniels, meanwhile, flashed his future All-Pro potential in the win, ending the day 24-of-36 for 227 yards and three touchdowns – with one interception – through the air while adding 127 yards off 16 carries on the ground. Ertz, who finished with two touchdowns, told the NBC broadcast after the game that the league is on “notice” with Daniels. “It’s been a long couple years honestly,” Ertz said. “Being able to play with Jayden at the end of my career is such a blessing for me. The kid is – the whole league should be on notice with him. Everyone loves playing with him. He’s the ultimate team guy. He’s the ultimate leader and he just gave me a chance at the end of the game.” As for Daniels, he not only fortified his Offensive Rookie of the Year resume, but he also made yet more NFL history along with it. He broke former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III’s rookie rushing mark of 815 yards set in 2012 following a seven-yard run in the fourth quarter. Daniels now has 864 rushing yards on the season, the most all-time for a rookie. Griffin III praised the young quarterback for breaking his record in a post on social media. Related articleEagles’ Saquon Barkley reaches 2,000-yard milestone as Philadelphia clinches NFC East “I wanted Jayden Daniels to break my rookie rushing record because I’m not about rooting against the next generation,” Griffin IIIposted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “He EARNED IT. He is the FUTURE. Some of these old heads need to stop drinking all that haterade and lift up these young guys instead of tearing them down.” With the win, not only do the Commanders punch their ticket to the playoffs but so do the Los Angeles Rams. Due to a strength of victory tiebreaker, the Rams win the NFC West over the Seattle Seahawks due to wins from the Commanders, Cincinnati Bengals, Buffalo Bills and Minnesota Vikings in Week 17. As for the Falcons, they no longer control their own destiny for the NFC South crown. Atlanta needs to defeat the Carolina Panthers in the final game of the NFL regular season next week and hope for a Tampa Bay Buccaneers loss to the New Orleans Saints to clinch a playoff spot. The Commanders face the Dallas Cowboys on the road next week and Daniels says that’s all he’s looking ahead to. “We going to have to see man,” Daniels said after the game. “I love my team against anybody. I love the brotherhood that we built, but we got to take it one game at a time. We go to and play Dallas (Cowboys) next week and we will worry about the playoffs after that.”",Sports
World No. 1 to return to World Blitz Chess Championship after resolving jeans controversy,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/sport/magnus-carlsen-rejoin-chess-championships-spt/,"World No. 1Magnus Carlsensays he will play at the World Blitz Championship after initially quitting the chess tournament due to adress code disputewith organizers. On Friday, Carlsen walked away from the World Rapid Chess Championship after refusing to change out of his jeans, which the International Chess Federation (FIDE) said breached the tournament’s dress code. As a result, Carlsen quit and said he would not return for the Blitz competition which starts on Monday in New York. However, in an interview with chess channelTake Take Takeon Sunday, the Norwegian said he would feature in competition after “fruitful” conversations with FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich and the main tournament sponsor. Carlsen, though, insisted he would continue wearing jeans. Oh, I am definitely playing in jeans tomorrow The 34-year-old, who has won five world rapid and seven world blitz titles in the last 10 years, was fined $200 for wearing jeans during the rapid tournament on Friday and was asked to change by the Chief Arbiter. He declined, explaining he had been at a lunch meeting before heading to the tournament’s second day and “barely had time” to change his clothes. After a standoff with FIDE, he then opted to walk away from the rapid tournament as a “matter of principle.” “This decision was made impartially and applies equally to all players,” FIDE said at the time, adding that fellow competitor Ian Nepominatchi also breached the dress code by wearing sports shoes but continued to play once he had changed. But in astatementon Sunday, FIDE president Dvorkovich said he regretted how the situation escalated. “It is unfortunate that the implementation of dress-code rules, while being legally sound and consistent, has left some feeling this is disproportionate and caused the situation everyone would have preferred to avoid,” he said, before announcing changes to the rules for the upcoming blitz tournament. Related articleMagnus Carlsen quits World Rapid and Blitz Championships after refusing to change out of jeans “Based on the consultations with our partners and their preferences, I took the decision to trial an approach to provide more flexibility to FIDE officials in judgements regarding the suitability of the attire. “The principle is simple: it is still required to follow the official dress-code, but elegant minor deviations (that may, in particular, include appropriate jeans matching the jacket) are allowed.” Carlsen, who has won five world rapid and seven world blitz titles in the last 10 years, has continually butted heads with FIDE, the sport’s governing body, over the years. When initially announcing his decision to quit the tournaments, Carlsen said his “patience with (FIDE) wasn’t very big to begin with.” However, he rowed back on some of his comments on Sunday. “I did have some choice words for FIDE in my interview with you,” he told the Take Take Take channel on Sunday. “I would say that it was a bit imprecise. I definitely mean it when it comes to certain people in FIDE, no question about it. I think the situation was badly mishandled on their side.” In his Sunday statement, the FIDE president recognized the need to change elements of the rulebook. “The concerns raised by Magnus Carlsen highlight the need for further discussion about how to modernize the current approach, to ensure that our rules and their application reflect the evolving nature of chess as a global and accessible sport,” Dvorkovich said.",Sports
Nicole Kidman’s erotic thriller wraps up a big year for female desire in pop culture,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/style/2024-year-female-libido-desire-popular-culture/,"While women’s desire is nothing new and certainly not a trend, 2024 has seen the female sex drive take the wheel in popular culture. It feels apt that the year will close — culturally speaking, at least — with the release of “Babygirl.” The movie, which came out on Christmas Day in the US (January 10 in the UK), stars Nicole Kidman as a high-powered businesswoman who becomes sexually submissive to one of her interns. “It’s told by a woman, through her gaze,”said Kidman at a press conferenceduring the Venice Film Festival screening in August. “That’s, to me, what made it so unique … and freeing.” “Babygirl” is directed by the Dutch filmmaker Halina Reijn, who at the same press conference said that she hoped the movie would address “the huge orgasm gap” that exists between men and women. While there have been plenty of expressions of female sexuality throughout history — from the banned books of late Irish novelist Edna O’Brien to Jane Birkin’s orgasmic vocals in 1967’s “Je t’aime moi non plus” and rapper Cardi B’s spit take-inducing lyrics on “WAP” — these have often been the exception, rather than the rule. But the past 12 months have seen explicit examples of female desire rush in simultaneously from the margins to the mainstream. From film to TV, music and literature, the female gaze has been promoted wholesale without shame, secrecy or euphemism. Here are some highlights from 2024. One singer whose popularity has soared this year is Chappell Roan. In January her monthly listeners on Spotify hovered around 1 million — now it’s a little over 43 million. A key part of Roan’s success has been her authentic representation of queer relationships, peppering her lyrics with sexual references such as “I heard you like magic/ I’ve got a Wand and a Rabbit” — a nod to two popular vibrator styles. Pop princess Sabrina Carpenter also wasn’t mincing her words. When Carpenter launched her album “Short n’ Sweet” on Instagram in August, it was accompanied by the caption “four days of ovulation” — a sentiment which fit the record’s hypersexual lyrics of “come ride on me/ I mean camaraderie” and the straightforward “I’m so f**king horny.” The album went straight to number 1 in the Billboard 200 chart. Summer 2024 was soundtracked by Tinashe’s “Nasty” in which the singer repeatedly asks for someone to “match her freak.” Meanwhile, in September FKA Twigs released “Eusexua,” a single from her forthcoming album of the same name. Earlier in the year, during an interview with British Vogue, the musician explained that she coined the word as a way of describing the “sensation of being so euphoric” that one could “transcend human form.” Women whispering (and shouting) sweet nothings weren’t limited to music, either. Subscription-based audio erotica app Quinn launched five years ago and says its revenue grew by440% over the past two yearsafter a string of celebrities including actors Andrew Scott and Victoria Pedretti voiced its stories. “Talent started to want to talk to us about narrating,” said Quinn’s founder and CEO, Caroline Spiegel, in a phone call to CNN. “That was a big shift… I don’t think it would have happened earlier. Female desire has existed in little pockets throughout history but now it’s everywhere and not hidden anymore. It is definitely more explicit now.” This is exactly as Spiegel thinks it should be — and is very much in line with Quinn’s values: “We believe sex is a healthy, happy part of life not something that should be relegated to a dark, scary corner of the internet,” she said. “Sex content doesn’t have to be overly graphic and jarring and instead can be just another piece of your media diet.” Which perhaps explains why the top audiobook of 2024 (both in the US and globally) according to Spotify’s annual “Wrapped” feature, was a “romantasy” book about sexy fairies called “A Court of Thorns and Roses” by Sarah J. Maas. In fact, four of the top 10 audiobooks in the US for this year were romantasy novels — three by Maas — earning the writer the accolade of being the streaming service’s global top author. On television, a wealth of shows also put female pleasure first, including an adaptation of Lisa Taddeo’s bestselling book “Three Women”on Starz, which unraveled the complicated reality of three characters’ very different sex lives. On Disney+ an adaptation of British romance novelist Jilly Cooper’s book “Rivals” — set in 1980s England — gave female pleasure top billing. Cooper has long centered women’s desire in her writing, but her raunchy vision was given new life this year with shoulder pads, non-ironic mustaches and braying chauvinism on the small screen. Elsewhere, “Bridgerton” came back for a third season that made global headlines thanks to a groundbreaking sex scene between the newly engaged Penelope Featherington (played by Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton). The scene depicted Penelope’s first time — and championed consent and respect while not compromising on spiciness; it lasted just shy of six TV minutes and according to the actors the chaise longue broke during filming. While society has led us to believe that sexual appetite is traditionally the domain of the young and supple — for those with dewy skin and cropped tops — 2024 challenged that notion. Miranda July’s novel “All Fours” is a requiem to perimenopausal desire. It follows the protagonist — a married, successful mother — on an ultimately abortive road trip during which she falls for a younger man who works at a car hire company. Despite their chemistry, the young married man Davey, won’t sleep with her, leaving the unnamed protagonist to masturbate furiously to no satisfaction. “I would never get what I wanted anymore, man-wise,” she laments at one point. The novel was an instant New York Times bestseller, perhaps because it gave voice and insight into a time of life that is underrepresented and rarely discussed. Elsewhere, actor Gillian Anderson edited “Want,”a portal into the minds of what women really crave but do not always feel able to say. The 174 anonymous sexual fantasy entries are just a tiny sample of the 800 submissions Anderson received from all over the world and ranging from the more popular reveries (threesomes) to the surreal (robots) and the quietly heart-breaking (craving admiration from a cold husband). Anderson wrote in the introduction that she hoped the book will “start a new conversation about sexual power.” That conversation — and a greater emphasis on female sexual pleasure — was well underway in 2024, said Dr. Justin Lehmiller, social psychologist and senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction at Indiana University. According to Lehmiller andrecent studiesinto female masturbation, the topic of women’s sexual experience and self-pleasure is less taboo than ever before. Lehmiller pointed to the growing market of sex toys and products aimed at enhancing women’s fulfilment. “This shows just how mainstream women’s pleasure has gone,” he added in a phone interview with CNN While Lehmiller points to women’s liberation — citing the birth control pill as well as women’s economic and educational gains — as major game changers when it comes to female sexual freedom, it’s not the full picture. Today, psychology and sex therapy are now fields predominantly occupied by women which has dramatically changed how female pleasure is perceived, he said. “In the past these fields were dominated by men who had very different ideas about what it is that brought women pleasure: they had a lot of fundamental misunderstandings,” Lehmiller explained. “A century ago, Freud was the biggest voice — he had a lot to say about female orgasm and how women should be experiencing pleasure. But as women have come to the forefront of the field, they have changed the conversation.” And they’re no longer talking quietly, among themselves.

6 foods and drinks we lost in 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/food/discontinued-food-drinks-2024/,"You might’ve indulged in some of the final bites and slurps of your favorite food and drinks without even realizing it. This year marked the end for many foods and drinks, most notably Panera’s controversial Charged Lemonade. We also said goodbye to a newly launched flop from Coca-Cola and a multicolored gum that was the cornerstone of many kids’ lives. Restaurants and food manufacturers are constantly making changes based on what’s selling and what’s not, so it’s no surprise that these items are disappearing. But it doesn’t make their losses any easier for fans. Here are some culinary creations that left us this year, listed alphabetically. Coca-Colaannounced in Septemberthat it was discontinuing its newSpiced flavorjust six months after the company touted the“permanent” addition in a splashy launch. The company didn’t provide a specific reason, though confusion about the flavor (it wasn’t actually spicy) likely contributed to lackluster sales. Coke said it’s launching an “exciting new flavor” in 2025. The gum, perhaps best was known for its fruit-inspired flavors and zebra-print packaging, was discontinued in January afterroughly six decades in production.Brand owner Ferrara, which also produces Nerds, Fun Dip and other candies, said discontinuing Fruit Stripe was a “difficult decision.” The company cited “many factors” for its demise, including purchasing patterns and changing consumer preferences. After nearly a century, the flavorful preserves and jams were discontinued in January. J.M. Smucker Co., its parent company, said in a statement that the change was in “alignment with our strategy to continuously evaluate our portfolio” and that it’s focusing onrecently acquired Hostess products. One of the most iconic crossovers in the grocery store aisle is no more. Cereal company Post Consumer Brands said in December that Oreo O’s rings will be replaced with puffs after nearly 30 years. “Oreo Puffs is a permanent addition to store shelves that will replace Oreo O’s in the cereal aisle,” a company representativetold the Food Network, which is also owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. Panera Bread pulledCharged Lemonade, the caffeinated beverage that sparked multiple lawsuits and caused a public relations nightmare for the company, from itsmenu in Mayafter two years. It wasn’t just the controversial lemonade that faced eviction this year: Panera also eliminated dozensof items,including flatbreads, several sweet treats and chili, in the “largest transformation ever” for its menu. Turns out,olive-oil infused drinksweren’t a hit with Starbucks’ customers. The company nixed the drinks in October less than a year after theirnationwide debut. Oleato was the brainchild offormer CEO Howard Schultzbut met largely negative responses from media and consumers. Starbucks’ lineup of iced energy drinks was also removed just a few months after their June debut.",Everyday
"The best, worst and weirdest pop culture moments of 2024",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/entertainment/pop-culture-moments-2024-cec/,"Whew. That’s the way we feel as we round the bend into the final days of the year. We really had it ALL in 2024: Era-defining albums, the Olympics, the return of the blockbuster movie musical, a devastatingly cute pygmy hippo. You might not remember it all, but we took note of every niche pop culture oddity and TikTok fad. And there weremanysurprises — perennial history-maker Taylor Swift didn’t even make the cut this year. Helming thehighest-grossing tour everis probably enough recognition. Go down memory lane with us as we revisit the trends and crazes that got us through this wacky year — for better or worse. Best Midwesterner: Chappell Roan The “Good Luck, Babe!” singer’s debut album actually came out over a year ago, but 2024 belonged to Roan, whose fiery hair was outmatched only by her hot songs and piercing candor. She captivated us with lascivious lyrics about loving women,electric live performancesthat brought drag to festival stages and arefreshing refusal to bow to the demandsof an industry that too often wrings its stars dry. Our Midwestern Princess isreforming pop music in her image, and if the new songs she’s been teasing are any indication, she’ll dominate 2025, too. Best throuple: Tashi, Art and Patrick in ‘Challengers’ Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist vied for Zendaya’s affections in thegreat tennis romance “Challengers,”starting with a clumsy three-way kiss. Did these characters ever really care about each other? Where did tennis end and sex begin with these three frustrated athletes?! Here’s hoping that, after that cliffhanger ending, this trio made up (and made out). Silliest Sabrina Carpenter lyric: ‘That’s that me espresso’ Honorable mentions include “I know I Mountain Dew it for ya,” “j**k off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen” and Carpenter’s wish to find “a boy who’s nice that breathes.” On her2024 album “Short n’ Sweet,”our poet laureate of lust has a great wit. Best epic film: Jenny Nicholson’s 4-hour opus on Disney’s ‘Star Wars’ hotel Walt Disney World’s hotly anticipated “Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser” interactive hotelclosedwith little fanfare in 2023. Luckily for us, YouTube deep-diverJenny Nicholson performed athoroughautopsyof why the concept flopped, including hilariously dispiriting anecdotes from her own visit. Its failure is a foregone conclusion from the video’s start: The hotel’s experience just wasn’t fun enough to justify its exorbitant cost. Still, the journey to get there with Nicholson is the breeziest four hours we spent online all year. Hottest ticket on Broadway: Cole Escola’s ‘Oh, Mary!’ The buzziest show of the theatrical season is a farce focusing on a fictionalized First Lady who’s nasty, puerile and absolutelystarvedfor the spotlight. While star and playwright Cole Escola’s Mary Todd Lincoln is not quite historically accurate — Escola’s Mary is a one-time cabaret star who avoids her kids, torments her companions and cares only about returning to the stage — “Oh, Mary!” is certainly the funniest and most fabulous that the Mrs. Abraham Lincoln has ever been. Best pop manifesto: ‘Brat’ This year, the world finally caught onto what alt-pop fans have known for over a decade: Charli XCX is astar. With “Brat,” the Brit launched a hit album, a color, apresidential campaignand a state of being. To be brat is to be the life of the party while juggling the demands of your career and personal life — to dance into the wee hours and wake up the next afternoon wondering whether you should pause the partying to have kids. By those parameters, we canallbe brat. It only took Charli to show us the way. Funniest trainwreck: ‘Willy’s Chocolate Experience’ in Glasgow It was supposed to bemagical. But theunlicensed “Willy Wonka”-themed children’s eventin Scotland failed to deliver on any of its promises. It was staged in a cavernous warehouse with sparse sets. Among its cast was a demoralized Oompa Loompa who had to give out a single jelly bean per child. It inexplicably featured the character “The Unknown,” who appears in no previous iteration of the story. The cast did their best to hold things together, but nothing went right with “Willy’s Chocolate Experience” — except that footage from the event made its way across the pond so that we could all marvel at how hilariously awful it was. Most impressive practical magic: Pat McGrath’s porcelain Margiela makeup McGrath is our preeminent makeup sorceress, but her artistry ascended to dizzying heights this year when she transformed the models of Maison Margiela’s couture show into creepy porcelain dolls. Their glassy, opalescent skin inspired countless copycats whoalmostcracked the code, untilMcGrath graciously shared her secretsin a must-watch Instagram Live. Among the most surprising ingredients were peel-off face masks sold at drug stores, paired, of course, with McGrath’s line of foundation. High-low art! Best genre-bender: Beyoncé’s ‘Cowboy Carter’ Brave to cover a song as iconic as“Jolene”when you are neitherDolly Partonnor hergoddaughter, but if anyone is allowed anywhere near the classic, it’sBeyoncé. Billboard’sNo. 1 pop starof all time proved her country bonafides on Act II of her planned three-act album cycle. Surely no one would doubt that Bey, a Houston native with a Louisiana Creole background, is “country enough” after the release of this 27-track masterpiece, right?RIGHT?!?! Mostmovie of the year: ‘Wicked’ “Wicked” feverswept the world faster than poor Chistery sprouted wings. For us theater kids,its successwas thrilling — movie musicals are BACK! Ariana Grande can act! Anthony Bridgerton can dance!Goat professorscan be denied tenure! Offscreen, debates over cinematic lighting and color grading are raging! Glinda/Elphaba fanfiction is flourishing! The final scene is being spoiled by fans illegally filming inside theaters! Grande and Cynthia Erivo are holding space for the lyrics of “Defying Gravity”! And we get to do it all again next year for “Part II”! Best get-rich-quick scheme: Movie sequels Whatever happened to originality? Nine of the10 highest-grossing films of 2024were sequels (the only outlier is “Wicked,” an adaptation of a musical based on a book based on another book, with a sequel on the way next year). Gru’s minions are still banana-crazed, Kung Fu Panda is still kickin’, Joy of “Inside Out” is still underestimating Sadness. Business as usual in Hollywood. Best sneak attack: AI AI was already all the buzz last year, but somehow we weren’t expecting it to integrate itself into our lives so quickly. From suddenly making regular Google results obsolete, to quickly escalatinggreenhouse gas emissionsand becoming an“extinction-level” threat to humans, according to the State Department — we just didn’t think AI would take us out THIS quickly. The sci-fi movies warned us, but we didn’t listen. Well played, AI, well played. Most smoosh-able face: Moo Deng Whilelittle baby Haggisalmost usurped her crown,Moo Dengreigned supreme this year. From her chubby little cheeks to her propensity for biting, it’s no wonder the little pygmy hippo went viral this year, dominating the media cycle for MONTHS. We couldn’t get enough of her. Who hasn’t been annoyed and wanted to bite someone’s knee? She’s a pygmy for the people. Best public execution: Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar Drake has had a hard year. It’s tough when your industry nemesis (Kendrick Lamar) drops a flurry of diss tracks essentially calling you a fraud, one of which (“Not Like Us”) went triple platinum atmany a summer kickback. In a final blow, the NFL named Kendrick as next year’s Super Bowl halftime show, effectively cementing him as the winner of the (somehow still ongoing) feud. Drake’s attempt at a legal battle only makes the whole affair that much harder to watch, a last-ditch effort by a man who knows he’s already lost. Womp womp. Best sidekick: The Rizzler They’re Costco Guys — ofcoursethey’replaying boom or doomwith their 8-year-old sidekick the Rizzler, chomping down on chicken bakes and double chunk chocolate cookies. Didn’t understand a word of that sentence? Probably for the best. Best definitely not overused catchphrase: ‘Very demure, very mindful’ You see how we’re writing this pop culture year in review? You see how nicely edited it is, not a punctuation mark out of place?Very demure, very mindfulof us! Best industry plant: Glen Powell Oh, so we’re just supposed to believe that a 6-foot-tall man from Texas with the sharpest jawline we’ve ever seen and a fluffy little dog named Brisket just came through Hollywood organically, and somehow captured the nation’s collective heart in a year full of upheaval???? Puh-lease. We loved himin “Twisters,” but we’re no fools. Best Hollywood obsession: MILFs “The Idea of You.” “Babygirl.” “A Family Affair.” “Between the Temples.” In the grand scheme of things, four movies all on the same subject might not seem like much. But that all four have something to do witholder womengoing after younger guys? All released this year? Hmmmmmm. Hollywood, what are you trying to tell us? Best soap opera: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck From including Ben’s love letters in a critical flop of a movie in February, to a highly publicdivorce filing in August, Jennifer Lopez has had one wild turn of the heart this year. And, for better or worse, we’ve been privy to all of it. Now, somehow Jennifer Garner (Ben’s ex-wife) iscatching strays, Jenny from the Block is making headlines for herrevealing fashion choices, and we’re all stuck in a trance, watching the mess at home from our screens. Best 15 seconds of fame to actual fame leap: Hawk Tuah Girl After going viral for giving an honorable oral sex tip (“You gotta give ‘em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on that thang”), Hailey Welch leapt to podcaster, social media influencer, dating advice guru — and even threw a first pitch at a New York Mets game. All in about six months! But fame has its downsides. In pendulum swing, she’s now facing questions after her crypto currency, HAWK, skyrocketed and plummeted within minutes of it’s launch — in what crypto insiders are alleging wasa scam and a “pump-and-dump”scheme. Oof. That’s showbiz, baby. Best main character: The Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games Pommel Horse Hero.Raygun. That French pole vaulter and his you-know-what. EvenFlavor Flav! Let’s face it, this summer, these athletes, and so many others, were the only things anyone was talking about. Did anything else happen between July 26 and August 11? We have no idea. Time stood still. We were hypnotized via pommel horse. Best culture upending saga: Reesa Teesa’s ‘Who TF Did I Marry?’ This was a level of cultural obsession we haven’t seen in years. Decades even! Everyone was watching this TikTok epic; for weeks, we heard Reesa Teesa’stale of heartbreakvia (alleged) scammer across social media, around the office, and even streaming out of car stereos. Now, there’s set to be a TV adaptation starring our longtime fave (as real readers of this review will know)Natasha Rothwell. Next time our hearts get broken, we will definitely be letting Netflix know. Best way to ditch the dating apps: Celeb lookalike parties Swiping is sooo 2023. Put your phone down andtake to the streets! Looking for a Jeremy Allen White look-alike? What about a Dev Patel copy-and-paste? Zendaya more your thing?Timothée Chalamet? Aforementioned industry plant Glen Powell? Whatever you’re searching for, there’s a lookalike contest for you.",Entertainment
The worst-behaved travelers of 2024,https://www.cnn.com/travel/worst-behaved-travelers-of-2024/,"Editor’s note: Sign up forUnlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay. Sometimes it’s ignorance. Sometimes it’s hitting the airport bar too hard. Sometimes it’s being far from home and seemingly far from consequences. In the post-Covid era, more people are traveling than ever before. Record-breaking numbers of tourists also mean there was no shortage of unruly traveler incidents in 2024. To remedy this, CNN Travel has put together this list of New Year resolutions for all you globetrotter and gadabouts out there. In 2025, let’s do better. The US Federal Aviation Administration investigated more than 2,000unruly passenger incidentsin 2024. That’s a big drop from a record high of 5,973 in 2021, but still nearly twice as many reports as in the pre-Covid era. A couple were banned by Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific after an argument overseat-reclining etiquetteon a flight from Hong Kong to London in September descended into xenophobic insults and physical violence. There was a ferocious unprovoked attack by a passenger on anothersleeping passengeron a United Airlines flight in October, but usually it was flight attendants who were at the receiving end of criminal behavior. In January, an All Nippon Airways (ANA) plane bound for Seattle was forced to turn around after a male passengerbit a female flight attendant, the airline said. That same month, an American Airlines flight bound for Montana wasdiverted to Texasafter a passenger punched a flight attendant multiple times. A California man faced charges in September after allegedlytrying to chokea Frontier Airlines flight attendant and threatening to “kill everybody” on board a flight to San Francisco that had to be diverted. In February, an American Airlines flight was forced to return to Albuquerque after a man tried toopen the emergency exit, passengers said. On another American Airlines flight in November, this time bound for Dallas, a passenger wasduct-tapedafter trying to do the same thing, authorities said. A flight in China was delayed four hours after a passenger threw coins into the engine, apparently a gesture for“good luck.” Finally, an Australian passenger whose disruptive behavior caused his Sydney-bound flight to turn around and go back to Perth was ordered to pay more than $5,000 back to the airline tocover the fuel costs. As is the case every year, airport staff around the world intercepted people trying to smuggle a whole menagerie of animals through security. There was the man with100 live snakesdown his pants, another with300 tarantulasstrapped to his body, the90 giant African snailsdiscovered in Detroit and the endangeredred pandafound in Bangkok alongside 86 other animals. Smugglers found some inventive ways to (unsuccessfully) conceal methamphetamine. A California man was arrested Los Angeles International Airport after he allegedly tried to check two suitcases packed with meth-caked clothing, including acow pajama onesie. Earlier this month. a Canadian woman was arrested after custom officials said they found more than 10 kilos of meth worth up to $2.2 million in her hand luggage, disguised asChristmas presents. LAX was also where another female passenger was caught with enough materials to have ended 2024with a bang. She was detained in December after 82 fireworks, three knives, two replica firearms and a canister of pepper spray were found inside her hand luggage. Italy is one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, but not all of its visitors are respectful of its cultural treasures and millennia of history. In July, Florence officials were on the hunt to identify a young woman seen mimickingsexual actswith a statue of Bacchus, the god of wine and sensuality, in photos that went viral on social media. In the ancient city of Pompeii, frozen in time since the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE, a British tourist was caught in Augustcarving initialsinto one of its 2,000-year-old homes. In the UNESCO world heritage site of Matera, filled with precious historic buildings, damage was done in June by a group of parkour enthusiasts from London. The sport involves running, climbing and leaping over obstacles — orsmashing straight into them, as was the case here. Japan had a record number of visitors in 2024 — more than 33 million of them — attracted in part by a relatively weak Yen and an increase in direct flights. This wasn’t without its problems. A Japanese townput up a barrierto block a popular view of Mount Fuji after being overrun by tourists leaving litter and causing traffic problems. Kyoto, the former Japanese capital, cracked down on“geisha paparazzi” harassing the traditional female entertainers. Tourists were also arrested for such crimes asdefacing the gateof a shrine andhaving sexinside a shrine. The 3,922-step Haiku Stairs in Hawaii were built by the US Navy during World War II and have been officially closed to the public since 1987 — but problems with illegal trespassing have multiplied in the age of social media. Due to the number of YouTubers, TikTokers, thrill-seekers and other tourists sneaking on the picturesque yet off-limits beauty spot, authorities made the decision to dismantle the steps, at a cost of $2.5 million. This iswhy we can’t have nice things. A much newer attraction, two public sculptures in New York and Dublin joined by a 24-7 video link, opened in May and immediately ran into problems. It turned out that when people can see but not hear each other, some will turn tobaser forms of communication— such as breast-flashing or holding up pornographic and offensive imagery. The “Portal,” as it was known, shut down permanently in September. An influencer couple from Arizona were forced to defend their parenting after many of their online followers believed them to haveleft their children aloneon a cruise, while a British TV presenter kicked up a storm after posting on X about allowing her 15-year-old son to travel around Europewithout an adult. Social media trends including inflight“raw-dogging”(isn’t language evolution a curious thing) and posting artfulphotos of airport traysgot people in a tizzy. Video even emerged apparently showing an airplane passenger posing inside an overhead bin. Here’s an explanation of why that’s reallynot a good idea. What questionable or dangerous activities did people get up to in America’s national parks this year? Well, two Nevada men were indicted in August for allegedly damaging ancient rock formations at the much-loved Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Yellowstone, the world’s first national park and one of America’s most visited, was the site of a couple of notable incidents. In April, a man was accused ofkicking a bison, which then injured him. Then in July, a car carrying five people ran off the road and into one of the park’s famous hot geysers — thankfully, all were able toescape the vehiclewith non-life-threatening injuries. Littering continued to be an issue. Even a dropped bag of Cheetos can have a “world-changing impact” on fragile ecosystems, as Carlsbad Caverns National Park explained inthis videofrom September. Over in Nepal, authorities also took steps to minimize pollution. Mount Everest climbers now have totake their poopaway with them, as human excrement has become a big problem on the world’s highest peak. One of the most evocative new slurs of 2024 was“gate lice,”  a derogatory term for people who cluster around their boarding gate before it’s their time to get on the plane. In October, American Airlines introduced new technology to cut down on line-cutters. When when someone tries to board before their assigned group, an alert sounds and the transgressor has to do the walk of shame back to the waiting area. In New Zealand, loitering in the car park drop-off zone was the concern, as one airport took the step of introducing atime limit on hugs. Describing airports as “hotbeds of emotion,” Dunedin Airport CEO Daniel De Bono said “our team have seen interesting things go on … over the years.” Apopular Australian nude beachnorth of Byron Bay had its clothing-optional policy revoked after reports of “offensive, obscene or antisocial behavior.” For more on how to lose your clothes but not your manners, have a look at our perennial guide tonude beach etiquette. After that, you might also be interested in learningwhat tourists get wrongwhen visiting France and how you can avoid the“stupid American” stereotypewhen traveling abroad. Tourism is the main driver of many economies around the world, but 2024 is when thenegative effects of mass tourismcame to a head in protests across Europe and an increase in tourist taxes and visitor caps around the world. Barcelonaended apartment rentalsby foreign tourists, Italybanned Airbnb self-check-insand Amsterdam banned construction ofnew hotels. Melbourne bannedelectric scooter rentals, Florence bannedtour guide loudspeakers, Prague bannedbar crawlsand Milan considered banningpizza and gelato salesafter midnight. However, having a lovely time while engaging respectfully with locals and supporting local businesses is still legal pretty much anywhere, so as the new year dawns, let’s give that a whirl.","World, Society"
"Employees of the hotel where Liam Payne fell to his death and his manager are charged with manslaughter, prosecutor says",https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/liam-payne-death-charges-intl/,"Five people have been charged in connection with the death of former One Direction star Liam Payne in Argentina, the country’s prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Monday. The British singer fell to his death from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires in October. He was 31. Payne’s manager, as well as the hotel’s manager and its head of reception, have been charged with manslaughter, the prosecutor’s office said. If convicted, they face up to five years in prison, according to Reuters. A hotel employee and a local waiter have also been charged with supplying Payne with cocaine during his stay, and the judge has ordered them to be jailed ahead of their trial. They could face up to 15 years in prison, Reuters reported. Payne had alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system before his death, Argentinian prosecutors said last month. He had spoken openly about his struggles with substance abuse and his mental health. In the summer of 2023, Payne said he was marking six months of sobriety after completing treatment in a US facility. Payne’s tour was set to kick off in South America in September of that year, but he had topostponethe scheduled dates after suffering a kidney infection. Payne’s death shocked the music world. He rocketed to global stardom as part of One Direction, one of Britain’s biggest ever boybands whichwas created on the British X Factor in 2010. The group, which included members Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik, announced an “indefinite hiatus” in 2016. The four former bandmates attended Payne’s funeral service in Amersham, northwest of London, in late November. Music mogul Simon Cowell – who masterminded the group’s formation on the X Factor – was also at the service. Shortly before his death, Payne had been seen in Argentina attending his former bandmate Horan’s concert. On the night of October 16, staff at the hotel where Payne had been staying requested urgent police assistance. In an emergency call obtained by CNN’s Argentina affiliate Todo Noticias, a staff member told police: “We have a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol… He breaks things up. He is tearing the whole room apart.”",Entertainment
Shocked families demand answers over deadly South Korea plane crash,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/asia/south-korea-plane-crash-victims-families-intl-hnk/,"The sounds of sobbing, prayers and anguish echoed through the departures hall of an airport in southwestern South Korea on Monday as families of the victims killed when apassenger jet crash-landedover the weekend waited for their loved ones to be identified. All but two people on a Jeju Air plane carrying 175 passengers and six crew died after it crashed at the airport in Muan County just after 9 a.m. local time on Sunday – in what is the deadliest aviation disaster the country has seen in nearly 30 years. Loved ones inside Muan International Airport wept as medics announced the names of the victims who had been identified. So far, 146 victims have been identified, while efforts are underway to name the remaining 33 bodies, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. In the soaring atrium that normally serves as the airport’s departure hall, scores of families huddled together, murmuring hushed prayers. Some were seen wrapped in each other’s embrace, weeping, while several monks spoke to gathered groups. Rows of yellow tents stood erected for people who had stayed overnight. Several relatives could be seen yelling at officials, demanding more information. Investigators are working to pinpoint what may have caused the crash of Jeju Air flight 7C 2216, which was flying from Bangkok to Muan. South Korean officials confirmed on Monday that the pilot had reported a bird strike before he made the doomed emergency landing. “The pilot reported an emergency declaration and go-around due to a bird strike,” said Kang Jung-hyun, a senior official at the transport ministry. The pilot said “mayday, mayday, mayday” three times and used the terms “bird strike” and “go-around,” the official said. A “go-around” isan aviation termthat means a landing is aborted when a plane nears a final approach and instead the pilot will instead increase speed and ascend before attempting another approach or diverting elsewhere. Footage of Sunday’s crash broadcast by multiple South Korean news outlets showed that neither the back nor front landing gear was visible. Video showed the plane, a Boeing 737-800, sliding on its belly at high speed, hitting an earthen embankment and erupting in a fireball. Experts told CNN that the plane’s undercarriage – specifically, the wheels used for takeoff and landing – appeared not to have fully deployed. But what caused this failure to deploy, something analysts said was extremely rare, is still unclear. Two black boxes – the flight data and voice recorders – have been recovered from the crash site, according to a briefing by the transport ministry. But the flight recorder suffered external damage that required it to be sent to an analysis center in Seoul to see how much information could be extracted and whether it needed to be sent to the United States, the ministry said. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is leading a team of US investigators, including from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, to assist South Korean authorities. The NTSB said any information would be released by South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board. South Korea’s transport ministry said Monday that the control tower had warned the pilot about birds in the area shortly before the pilot reported a bird strike, made the mayday call and asked to land in the opposite direction. The ministry made the clarification after saying Sunday the control tower had instructed the pilot to change course shortly after he made the mayday call. The landing attempt occurred about two minutes after the mayday call, according to the ministry. Uncertainty remains as to what exactly went wrong, with some aviation experts questioning how much impact a bird strike could have had in bringing down the Jeju Air plane. The transport ministry said the head pilot on the flight had held the role since 2019 and had about 6,800 hours of flight experience. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, has declared seven days of national mourning and ordered an investigation into the country’s entire airline system. The transport ministry will inspect all Boeing 737-800 planes in the country, according to Deputy Transport Minister Joo Jong-wan. A total of 101 planes of the model used by six airlines are subject to the inspection with authorities looking at each jet’s maintenance record on major parts, including the engine and landing gear, Joo said. “We will transparently disclose the progress of the investigation into the accident, even before the final results are released, and keep the bereaved families informed,” Choi said Monday at a disaster control meeting in Seoul. A day earlier, Choi, also the country’s finance minister, had arrived at the scene of the crash and declared it a special disaster zone as he expressed his “heartfelt condolences” to the families of the victims. The tragedy comes only two days after he assumed presidential duties following parliament’svote to impeach prime ministerHan Duck-soo, who had been acting president since President Yoon Sul Yeol was impeached and suspended from power following his short-lived martial law decree earlier this month. Choi is leading the centralized disaster control team, a responsibility typically assumed by the prime minister. More than 700 personnel from the police, military, and coast guard have been mobilized for on-site response efforts, according to the transport ministry. Mourners have begun laying flowers and candles at a public memorial altar set up in Muan to honor victims of the crash, according to video by Reuters news agency. The victims of Sunday’s crash include 84 males, 85 females, and 10 people whose gender could not be determined, according to the South Jeolla Fire Service. Both of the survivors were crew members, one man and one woman, according to the rescue team. Two Thai nationals were among those on board, according to the South Korean transport ministry. All the other passengers were South Korean. A father of one of the Thai victims, Boonchuay Duangmanee, told the Associated Press he “never thought that this would be the last time we would see each other forever.” His daughter, Jongluk, had been working in a factory in South Korea for several years, he told the AP. She had been in Thailand visiting family before departing on the flight from Bangkok to Muan. “I heard that the plane exploded in Korea this morning. But I did not expect at all that my daughter would be on this flight,” he said. Another man who lost his daughter told Reuters he had not heard from her before the crash. “She was almost home so she didn’t feel the need to make a call,” 71-year-old Jeon Je-Young said of his daughter Jeon Mi-Sook. “She thought she was coming home. I figure in those last moments when she did try to reach out, the damage had already been done and the plane had probably crashed,” he said. Another bereaved family member told CNN affiliate JTBC that it is taking time to recover the bodies of crash victims because they are “severely damaged.” “I hope my siblings, my family, can be recovered and returned to us, even if only 80% intact,” he said, his voice breaking.

Stormy conditions expected across parts of the US on New Year’s Eve,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/weather/weather-forecast-new-years-eve/,"It’s no surprise that a year filled withextreme weatherwon’t be going out quietly with stormy conditions on the way for parts of the United States on New Year’s Eve, including some of the most populated areas of the Northeast. A quick-moving storm will race into the East on Tuesday and deliver potentially drenching rain anywhere from the mid-Atlantic to the Northeast as the final hours of 2024 tick away. It’ll be quite wet for New York City’s iconic New Year’s Eve celebrations. Rain will move into the city early Tuesday evening and could be heavy at times, especially from 8 p.m. to midnight when an estimated1 million peoplepack into Times Square. The final day of 2024 will feel more like mid-November in the city with a high temperature in the low 50s Tuesday afternoon. Temperatures will remain steady throughout the evening and will be around 50 degrees leading up to midnight. A few thunderstorms are possible anywhere from coastal North Carolina to southern New England within this larger area of rain, including in New York City, Philadelphia and Boston. These storms aren’t expected to become severe, but any lightning strikes could be dangerous for people celebrating the turn to 2025 outdoors. While the East mainly encounters rain in the last hours of 2024, parts of the Midwest are in for a sloppy New Year’s Eve as some snow mixes with rain at times. Chicago will start the day with rain but snowflakes will start to mix in later in the afternoon and this wintry mix will continue until around midnight. Similar conditions will unfold in Detroit. Powerful winds are roaring over the Rockies on Monday butmuch of the Plains and West will end up dry and calmer onTuesday. Parts of California will be the exception and have to contend with a new batch ofSanta Ana winds. Any celebratory fireworks or other sparks in Southern California on Tuesday or Wednesday could easily set off new blazes that potentially exhibit “extreme fire behavior” in very dry and breezy areas, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned. This Santa Ana wind event will peak in strength late Tuesday into early Wednesday and deliver widespread wind gusts of 30 to 45 mph, with isolated gusts to 55 mph in parts of Southern California. These winds – along with plenty of dry air – mean level 1 of 3 fire weather conditions are in place Tuesday from Santa Barbara to parts of the Los Angeles basin, including the Santa Monica Mountains, the San Fernando Valley and portions of the San Gabriel Mountains, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Santa Ana winds drove the explosiveFranklin Firethat forced more than20,000 peoplefrom their homes in the Malibu area earlier this month.",Society
What tariffs may mean for gas prices in 2025,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/business/gas-prices-trump-2025-gasbuddy/,"More good news is coming to inflation-weary drivers: Gas prices are expected to drop in 2025 for the third straight year, according to GasBuddy projections shared exclusively with CNN. GasBuddy, which has accurately forecasted gas prices the past several years, expects thenational average for regular gasto fall to $3.22 a gallon next year. That would mark a modest decline from about $3.33 in 2024 and mark the lowest annual average since 2021. The forecast formuted prices at the pumpis a far cry from the spike above $5 a gallon nationally in mid-2022, anunprecedented surgethat rocked the American economy, crushed consumers and became the epicenter of the inflation crisis. Based on the new forecast, GasBuddy expects Americans will spend about $115 billion less on fuel in 2025 than they did in 2022. “2025 looks to continue the trend of slow-but-steady improvement at the pump,” Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis, told CNN in a phone interview. GasBuddy expects the national average will stay safely below $3.50 a gallon each month of 2025, even during the peak driving season of late spring and early summer. The typical household is expected to spend $2,252 next year on fuel. That would be above the pre-Covid level of $1,952 in 2019 but well below the record high of $2,715 in 2022. However, De Haan warned that this projection for tame gas prices could be disrupted by several X-factors, including President-elect Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico. “Trump is a bit of a wildcard. He tends to destabilize the status quo and that increases risk and makes it harder to predict prices,” said De Haan. Gas prices, highly visible and difficult for many to avoid, play an outsized role in how Americans feel about the economy and their financial health. They serve as a real-time barometer for the cost of living and influence consumer psychology. Trump has vowed to attack the cost of living by embracing American energy dominance. Trump wants to slash environmental regulations and ramp up permitting in an effort to boost the supply of oil and natural gas. Although gas prices have dropped sharply from mid-2022, Trump promised on the campaign trail to make them go much, much lower. “We’re going to get gasoline below $2 a gallon,” Trump said during a speech in September, though he did not specify when prices would fall that low. However, industry veterans arehighly skeptical of that claim– unless there is a recession or some other crisis on the way that crashes demand. GasBuddy is forecasting prices will stay well above $2 a gallon throughout 2025. Even at the cheapest end of the range of possible monthly prices, GasBuddy only expects the national average to fall to $2.81 in December 2025. “Our figures are not even on the same planet as what the President-elect has promised,” De Haan said. “We just don’t see the stars aligning for President-elect Trump to realize gas prices that low.” Although Trump’s drill-baby-drill focus could boost domestic production, the United States is already pumping more oil than any nation in world history. It’s not clear that production can go dramatically higher, nor that there is even demand for substantially more crude given how subdued prices are now. Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise Capital, told CNN that there is a risk unleashing too much supply will cause a glut, hurting energy prices and the oil-and-gas sector. “This is why economics, not politics, will drive the energy sector,” Thummel said. Of course, calls for gas prices to drop in 2025 could prove wrong if there is a natural disaster or geopolitical trouble that disrupts supplies. For example, an even wider crisis in the Middle East that includes Iran or even Saudi Arabia could drive oil prices sharply higher. Another risk is that Trump goes forward with his threat to impose a25% tariff on Canadaand Mexico on his first day in office. Yet Canada is the leading source of America’s foreign oil. Last year, the United States imported 1.4 million barrels of Canadian crude oil per day, accounting for more than half of total oil imports.Another 733,000 barrelsof Mexican crude were imported each day last year as well, according to federal data. GasBuddy’s De Haan estimates that a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico would lift retail gas prices by 30 cents to 70 cents a gallon. But a spike in gas prices is the last thing Trump would want voters to see when he takes office. That’s why GasBuddy assumes in its 2025 forecast that Trump will ultimately not slap a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican oil. Officials in Canada and Mexico have promised to respond to Trump’s threatened tariffs, raising the specter of a tit-for-tat tariff battle that derails the closely-integrated North American economy. De Haan said a full-blown trade war would likely dent demand for fuel, driving prices lower. “If we saw $1.99 gas,” he said, “it would be because of an economic calamity, not something Americans would cheer.”",Business
What experts see in the ‘shocking and disturbing’ video of New York man’s fatal beating in prison,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/us/robert-brooks-beating-marcy-prison/,"Body camera footage documenting thefatal beating of Robert Brooksat the hands of New York state corrections officers has triggered an outpouring of rage and condemnations – and analysis from experts who said the video shows a misuse of force by officers. Brooks, a man incarcerated at the Marcy Correctional Facility in central New York, was pronounced dead in the early hours of December 10 at a Utica hospital. Earlier in the day, he had been transferred from Mohawk Correctional Facility to Marcy and beaten by corrections officers in a medical examination room, while handcuffed with his hands behind his back. Body camera footage shows officers repeatedly punching and kicking Brooks in the face, chest, and groin until he stops moving. The New York Attorney General’s Office of Special Investigations hasopened an investigationinto Brooks’ death. Attorney General Letitia James pledged Friday to “use every possible tool available to us to investigate this death thoroughly and swiftly” and described the footage of the beating as “shocking and disturbing.” At least one of the officers involved, Anthony Farina, has resigned following the incident, according to the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. He, along with two other officers allegedly involved in the beating,were previously accused of assault, according to court documents obtained by CNN. It is difficult to draw conclusions about the situation because the video footage does not capture any audio or show what led up to the violence immediately preceding Brooks’ death. But in the opinion of several experts who reviewed the video, the footage showcases an excessive use of force by officers as well as a failure by other officers to intervene. “I can’t believe the excessive force that these corrections officers used,” Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD Detective and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told CNN Friday. Here’s more on what experts said about the video. Several law enforcement experts who spoke to CNN criticized the corrections officers’ use of force shown in the footage. Related articleVideo of inmate’s fatal beating shows him handcuffed as corrections officers punch and kick him Brooks, 43, seemed to be compliant with officers and not posing a threat as officers beat him, making the use of force potentially excessive under the law, according to Bryce Peterson, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a senior research scientist at the Center for Justice Research and Innovation. “Just because someone is handcuffed does not mean they cannot be subjected to force,” Peterson told CNN Friday. “However – and this is a big however – if someone is no longer a direct threat to the officers and is complying with instructions, it would certainly be excessive to strike them, choke them, etc.” From the body camera footage, it is unclear what led up to the beating or why Brooks was taken into a medical examination room by officers as the footage first shows Brooks face down and handcuffed as three officers carry him into the facility. A 1992 US Supreme Court ruling,Hudson v. McMillan, set the standard for police use of force, said Peterson, who was part of a team performing the first evaluation of a corrections body-camera program at a jail in Loudoun County, Virginia. The ruling established force is “only justified when it is used to maintain or establish discipline,” Peterson said. Peterson said potential excessive use of force is “particularly” evident “when officers are cleaning blood off Mr. Brooks’ face and then begin to strike him and continue to strike and grab him for the next 30 seconds.” Prosecutors could consider a range of charges, said Peterson, similar to the range of state and federal murder charges against four officers in the2020 killing of George Floydin Minneapolis, which included a charge of murder against the lead officer, as well as abetting manslaughter, failing to stop unreasonable force and deprivation of civil rights for the other officers at the scene. Related videoFormer federal prosecutor calls inmate beating death ‘appalling, frightening’ Alcazar, the retired NYPD Detective, told CNN Friday the footage was “horrible to watch.” The use of force “was inhumane. It was unnecessary,” he said. He added there appeared to be several sergeants in the room who failed to step in and stop corrections officers from beating Brooks. “They should have stepped in and stopped them immediately,” Alcazar said. Officers who did not actively participate in the beating but failed to intervene could also be held legally accountable, he explained. Alcazar noted in the video, the officers appear “pretty comfortable doing this, especially with a supervisor there.” Similarly, Jeremy Saland, a former federal prosecutor and criminal lawyer, described feeling “disgust” at the video. “Law enforcement, whether correction officers on the inside behind the jail wall, or police officers on the outside, have the responsibility to protect the public,” he told CNN Friday. The attorney general said Friday four of the corrections officers involved did not turn on their body-worn cameras, which were operating on “standby” mode and recording video without audio. Saland said it represented a “dereliction of duty” for the officers. The failure to turn on their cameras could indicate “an intentional act,” he added, with officers “withholding or holding back that audio to protect themselves.” None of the officers or their representatives have commented since the video came to light. However, the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, the union which typically speaks on behalf of prison employees, issued a statement describing the footage as “incomprehensible to say the least” and “certainly not reflective of the great work that the vast majority of our membership conducts every day.” At least three of the officers involved in the beating werepreviously accused of assault, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, told CNN Friday his “jaw dropped” when he saw the way two officers grabbed Brooks by his shirt and shoulders before forcing him to the back right corner of the room and holding him up against a wall as other officers looked on. “It looked like just enough force in the right direction to do real damage,” the physician said. He noted although Brooks was previously alert and responding as officers struck him, he does not seem to move or react to stimuli after officers pick him up, looking “slumped to the ground.” Related articleNew York governor orders firing of prison staffers involved in inmate’s fatal beating It is possible Brooks sustained a deadly spinal cord injury when officers grabbed him, hyperextending his neck, according to Faust. This could have caused “immediate or almost immediate paralysis of the body, including the respiratory muscles,” he said. An official cause of death has not been determined but the medical examiner’s preliminary findings show concern of asphyxiation due to neck compressions, according to CNN affiliateSpectrum News. The video shows a few minutes later, one of the officers appears to give him a sternum rub, which Faust said is used to try and assess if a person is conscious. Brooks does not seem to respond to the sternum rub. At the point that staff realized Brooks was unconscious, it should have triggered officers to immediately assess his airway, breathing, and circulation, and to provide CPR or other lifesaving measures if needed, he explained. Staff do not appear to perform CPR in any of the videos released by the attorney general, although one man seems to take defibrillator pads from the wall. The video ends before the pads may have been used. Additionally, Faust said, if the officers’ attack had injured Brooks’ spinal cord, officers should have immediately worked to stabilize his spine, holding his neck in place and then assessing his vital signs, according to Faust. “I’m very worried that he sustained a spinal cord injury in that video,” Faust said. State officials rushed to denounce the fatal beating. Gov. Kathy Hochul saidin a statementshe was “outraged and horrified” by the video of Brooks’ “senseless killing.” She added she ordered an investigation into Brooks’ death and directed the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision tofire 14 people involved. Federal officials are also looking into the case. “The FBI Albany Field Office and the Department of Justice are reviewing the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Robert L. Brooks to determine the appropriate federal response,” the FBI said in a statement to CNN. Department of Corrections and Community Supervision Commissioner Daniel Martuscello III said in his own statement the video left him feeling “deeply repulsed and nauseated” and he would implement “institutional change” at the department. And Julia Salazar, a New York state senator, called for theclosing of Marcy Correctional Facility, where she said “previous acts of unconscionable violence against incarcerated individuals” had been reported. Related article2 New York state prison inmates say they were waterboarded, beaten by guards The New York affiliate of the ACLU also pointed to a “culture of officer brutality + abuse at Marcy” ina post on X. “It shouldn’t take a cold-blooded killing captured on film to be a wake-up call to our leaders that the culture of officer brutality in NY prisons must be stopped,” wrote the organization. A2022 reportabout Marcy from the Correctional Association of New York, which provides independent oversight of prisons in the state, notes multiple problems at the facility, including allegations of “physical assaults” by staff on inmates and “pervasive allegations of racial discrimination.” Around 80% of inmates surveyed in the report said they had seen or been subjected to verbal, physical, or sexual abuse by staff. Inmates reported experiencing seemingly random assaults from the staff as well as targeted attacks meted out as punishment, the report found. The report recommended the Office of Special Investigations and Inspector General investigate the “widespread claims of abuse at Marcy.” The Department of Corrections and Community Supervision told CNN in a statement that they have “addressed or are in the process of addressing the majority of the recommendations contained in the 2022 CANY report on Marcy Correctional Facility.” In particular, they highlighted a broad expansion of their body-worn camera program. “One of those recommendations adopted has been DOCCS investment of millions of dollars to continue to expand fixed cameras in all facilities, along with body-worn cameras,” reads the department’s statement. “Body-worn cameras were deployed to Marcy Correctional Facility in May 2024. Those cameras were critical in preserving the evidence of the fatal attack of Mr. Brooks.” CNN’s Raja Razek, Caroll Alvarado and Tanika Gray contributed to this report.",Society
Three recent airplane incidents have stirred anxiety about air travel. How safe is it really?,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/business/plane-travel-crash-safety-record/,"Anxious airline flyers may well remember 2024 as the year their worst fears about the safety of air travel felt confirmed, as a series of unprecedented, and in some cases fatal, airplane incidents captured headlines. Three separate incidents last week — aboard South Korean, Canadian and Azerbaijani airliners — have stirred those anxieties during the busy holiday travel period. Butstatistics showthe risk of death or injury on a commercial flight is extremely low. The latest incident happened Sunday in South Korea when a Boeingpassenger jet crash-landedat Muan International Airport, killing 179 people — the deadliest aviation disaster in the country since 1997. In footage broadcast by multiple South Korean news outlets, the Jeju Air flight can be seen skidding on its belly at high speed, hitting an embankment and erupting in a fireball. It’s still unclear what caused the crash, though experts told CNN the plane’s undercarriage — specifically, the wheels used for takeoff and landing — appeared not to have fully deployed before hitting the tarmac. South Korean authorities are probing the cause of the disaster with the help of investigators from the United States. Related articleMore than 170 killed after South Korean jet crash-lands at airport. Here’s what we know In a Sundaystatementon X, Boeing extended its “deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones” and said it was ready to support Jeju Air. The crash came after 38 people were killed on Christmas Day when anAzerbaijan Airlines flightcrashed after entering Russian airspace in Grozny, Chechnya. It is unconfirmed what was behind the incident, but Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev hasaccusedRussia of accidentally shooting down the airliner. Russian President Vladimir Putin “apologized for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace” in a phone call with Aliyev last week, according to astatementfrom the Kremlin, but did not claim responsibility. And, on Saturday night, an Air Canada Express flight reported anon-fatal accident. The flight, operated by partner PAL Airlines and carrying 73 passengers, “experienced a suspected landing gear issue” after arriving at Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Nova Scotia, though no injuries were reported, according to the airline. These incidents closed out a year that has been less than flattering for the airline industry, particularly for beleaguered jet maker Boeing, which has faced heightened criticism about the quality of its products. In January, a panel blew off anAlaska Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737 Max fuselage. No passengers died, but the incident followed two fatal 737 Max crashes in recent years — one in 2018 and another in 2019 — which triggered a 20-month grounding of the model worldwide. Accidents — fatal or otherwise — on board the tens of millions of commercial flights taken each year are highly unlikely, according to thelatest datafrom the International Air Transport Association, the trade association of the world’s airlines. There were30 such accidentsrecorded in 2023, the most recent year for which full-year accident data are available, amounting to a risk of one accident every 1.26 million flights, says IATA. That’s lower than therisk the previous year, with one in every 770,000 flights reporting an accident. “You’re at more risk … driving to the airport than you are … flying on an aircraft,” Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in New Jersey, told CNN. “In some parts of the world, you’re … less safe on an escalator than you are flying in an aircraft.” “When accidents happen, obviously it catches everybody’s attention, but I think it’s really important for everybody to (take a) step back and let the investigators do their job,” he added. An airline safetystudypublished in August and co-authored by Arnold Barnett, a professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that between 2018 and 2022, the worldwide death risk per boarding was one in 13.7 million. Related articleFlying is getting scary. But is it still safe? In other words, if you picked a flight at random and boarded in that time period, your chance of dying in a plane crash or a terrorist act approached one in 14 million. But a strong safety record in the past does not guarantee the same in the future, and flyers may have newfound concerns given the recent spate of fatal crashes. The loss of more than 200 lives in the past few days alone will push the number of fatalities caused by commercial aviation accidents well above the 72 IATA recorded in 2023. IATA Director General Willie Walsh said in the industry group’s most recent annual safety report, published in February, that 2023’s safety performance “continue(d) to demonstrate that flying is the safest mode of transport.” However, he said “we can never take safety for granted” andthat “two high-profile accidents in the first month of 2024 show that, even if flying is among the safest activities a person can do, there is always room to improve.” Chris Isidore contributed reporting.","Business, Society"
Passengers report flames as Air Canada flight suffers ‘suspected landing gear issue’ after landing,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/americas/air-canada-flight-2259-plane/,"An Air Canada Express flight “experienced a suspected landing gear issue” after arriving at Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Nova Scotia on Saturday night, though no injuries were reported, according to the airline. Flight AC2259 – which took off from St. John’s, Newfoundland – was subsequently “unable to reach the terminal and customers were offloaded using a bus,” Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said in a statement to CNN. The flight, operated by partner PAL Airlines, was carrying 73 passengers, the statement said. The plane – a De Havilland DHC-8-402, according to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada – skidded down the runway for a “decent” distance, and passengers saw flames on the aircraft’s left side, passenger Nikki Valentine toldCNN newsgathering partner CBC. “The plane shook quite a bit and we started seeing fire on the left side of the plane and smoke started coming in the windows,” Valentine said. The Halifax incident echoed a far more severe – and deadly – incident in South Korea on Sunday morning local time, when aJeju Air flight crash-landedat Muan International Airport, killing 179 people. Officials and aviation experts say a landing gear malfunction appears likely in that incident. While no one was hurt in Halifax, “we appreciated this incident was unsettling for customers and we remain available to assist them,” Air Canada’s statement said. The airfield was closed for about 90 minutes before one of its two runways was cleared for flight operations, Tiffany Chase, a spokesperson for the Halifax International Airport Authority, said in a statement. “Four flights were diverted and there were a handful of cancellations and delays while the airfield was closed,” she added. The incident will be investigated by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which in a notice Sunday said it was deploying a team of investigators to the airport. They are expected to arrive later Sunday. In the meantime, the aircraft remains on the runway, Chase said. Air Canada is waiting for the Transportation Safety Board to release the aircraft before returning customers’ belongings. The cause of the suspected landing gear issue is unknown, the airline said, adding, “Out of respect for the investigative process we cannot speculate and have no additional information to provide at this time.” This story has been updated with additional information.","Society, World"
Homeowners have no incentive to sell. Here’s why,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/economy/what-to-expect-housing-market-2025/,"This year, America’s once-in-a-generation housing slump deepened — but 2025 may not see much improvement. That’s partly becauseAmericans who locked inultra-low mortgage rates during the pandemic have little incentive to move into new homes and take on higher borrowing costs. “We’re coming into 2025 with a strong sense of déjà vu,” said Skylar Olsen, Zillow’s chief economist. “I think the difficulties of next year are going to be pretty similar to the difficulties of last year.” In 2024, Americans who bought homes wereolder and richer than ever. That’s because buying a home has grown more difficult amid a lack of affordable options. The median existing-home sales price was $406,100 in November, the 17th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases, according to the National Association of Realtors. In November 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic, the median sales price was $274,000, according to NAR. The significant jump in home prices made homeownersricher on paper. Meanwhile, rents have also risen, making it increasingly difficult for renters to save money for a down payment. Nearly half of all renterspaid more than 30%of their income toward housing costs, according to the US Census Bureau. Homelessness also hita record high in 2024, driven in part by a lack of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Homeowners have faced financial pressures of their own this year. Those who live in areas vulnerable to natural disasters have seen theirhome insurance premiums skyrocket, and inflation has caused the cost of home repairs to rise. Borrowing costs play a major role in housing affordability, as well. A few months ago, economists had predicted that mortgage rates would fall below 6% by the end of the year. But this month,the Federal Reserve signaledthat it may only cut interest rates twice next year, fewer times than expected. That has caused mortgage rates, which track the 10-year US Treasury yield, to climb higher: The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.85% last week, up from 6.61% this time last year, according to data from Freddie Mac. Olsen said Zillow expects mortgage rates to stay above 6% for all of 2025, ending the year at around 6.2%. It may be mixed news for house hunters next year. Here’s what economists expect of the housing market in 2025: The US housing market is on track for its worst sales year in nearly three decades, according to NAR data. A Septemberreportfrom the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that nearly 60% of the 50.8 million active mortgages had interest rates below 4%. The difference between a 4% mortgage rate and a 6% rate could equate to thousands of dollars a year in savings for the median homebuyer. Still, Chen Zhao, an economist at Redfin, said she expects a slow easing of rate pressures in 2025. “I think it’s mostly still going to be a trend in 2025,” she said. “But as time goes on, people’s reasons for moving accumulate and they get unlocked by necessity.” Major life events like having children or getting a job in a new city will require more people to put their homes for sale and move, even if it means giving up a sub-4% mortgage rate, she said. This year, existing-home sale prices continually hit record highs, according to NAR data. That haspadded the pocketsof Americans who already own homes, adding $5 trillion in household equity since the pandemic, said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. More than a decade ofchronic underbuilding— combined with more millennials, America’s largest generation, reaching the average age of homeownership — has caused demand to greatly outstrip supply. Those trends will likely persist in 2025, meaning that home prices will likely continue their upward ascent. However, home price growth may slow, said Olsen. “There have been more homes lingering on the market, and those homes will likely need price cuts,” she said. “It’s become more of a buyer’s market this year than the past two or three home-shopping seasons, when we were experiencing crazy home demand.” Location also matters, Olsen said, with homebuyers in Southern states likely to see steeper home price cuts than in other markets. Anew set of rulesgoverning how NAR members do business in the US officially took effect in August. Many experts predicted the rules would eventually do away with the 5% to 6% standard commission paid out by a home’s seller. NAR has said its commissions were always negotiable, but critics argued that these commissions had been baked into home listing prices, artificially inflating them. Home prices have continued climbing since the new rules have taken effect, though next year will see the first spring buying season with the new rules in place. It isn’t clear how much will change for homebuyers, Zhao said. “So far there hasn’t been a ton of evidence that commissions have come down,” Zhao said. Any commission change would most likely occur in the higher-end luxury home space, where Realtors get paid a percentage of a home’s sale and can command hundreds of thousands of dollars in commission, Zhao said. The US government can also pass legislation to help ease the burden of housing costs, something both Democrats and Republicansdiscussedon the 2024 campaign trail. Jaret Seiberg, a financial policy analyst at TD Cowen, has argued that Republican lawmakers may try to increase the availability of affordable housing through tax credits during President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming administration. “We expect housing to be a top political issue over the next two years,” Seiberg wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. “Our view is the GOP will need to address entry-level housing inflation in order to win future elections. This is why tax credit programs to boost construction are in play” However, Trump’sthreats to place hefty tariffson some of America’s largest trading partners, including China, Canada, Mexicoand the European Union, could backfire on the housing market, Zhao said. “If he does implement broad based tariffs, that means (mortgage) rates will have to stay high for one main reason, which is that you would expect some inflationary pressure,” she said.",Business

She died due to complications from recently discovered lung cancer, according to her representatives. Lavin’s long, illustrious career spanned both the stage and the screen and started at a young age; born into a musical family, Lavin has been performing since the age of 5, according to her alma mater,William & Mary. She got her big break in New York, cutting her teeth in Broadway plays and musicals throughout the 1960s. She starred in the 1966 musical “It’s a Bird … It’s a Plane … It’s Superman,” with the New York Times review at the time praising her performance as “fresh.” “I wish she was in every musical and revue,” wroteTimes critic Stanley Kauffmann. But it was the television show “Alice,” which follows a widowed mother pursuing her dreams of being a singer while working at a diner, that made Lavin a household name. She played the titular character throughout the show’s entire nine-season run from 1976 to 1985 – during which she wontwo Golden Globes, was nominated a third time, and was also nominatedfor an Emmy Award. In the following years she juggled television, film and theater, nabbing a Tony Award for her lead role in the 1986 play “Broadway Bound” – and more Tony nominations for several other projects. Her work never slowed over the years, with stints in voice acting, directing and producing, and teaching master classes at William & Mary. Her most recent performance was in the Netflix show “No Good Deed,” following three families fighting to buy the same house – which released earlier this month. She had been set to act in another play, “Mid-Century Modern,” in California in January. The news of her death sparked tributes and messages of mourning from those in Hollywood and Broadway who remembered her as a respected veteran who shaped the industry. Actress Patricia Heaton shared a video on X reminiscing about her time working with Lavin on the short-lived ABC sitcom “Room for Two”from 1992 to 1993. “She was such a legend. The first major role I had in television was playing her daughter,” Heaton said. “She was my mentor, my guardian angel. She really looked out for me, taught me a lot, not just about acting but about life. And we had dinner a couple months ago when I was in LA, and she was just as sharp and funny and energetic as she always has been.” “I’m going to miss her. She was a good friend,” Heaton added.

You no longer need a PhD in Disney World to make it affordable,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/travel/disney-world-affordable/,"Between figuring out Lightning Lanes and how to cram all the rides and meals the family wants into a single trip, planning a Disney World vacation is complicated enough — let alone if you’re trying to do Disney on a budget. An entire cottage industry of “Disney hacks” has popped up on social media in recent years, with influencers explaining how to navigate the complex web of deals and methods you can employ to save money on your Disney trip. You can even take online classes in Disney vacations, if you want. But Disney, long criticized for its high-priced tickets, is making a concerted effort to add simplicity to its park offerings so guests can figure out how to travel on a budget without needing a doctorate in Disney World. For example, Disney on Monday announced free dining plans for three-night Walt Disney World guests who buy a Park Hopper ticket and arrive between May 27 and June 26 or July 7 through August 6. Dining plans get ticketholders a couple of meals, a snack and a refillable mug for each night of their stay — i.e. one less thing to plan and worry about. They’re typically offered as an add-on purchase. Disney World previously announced other money-saving perks, including complimentary parking at resorts (it used to charge, much to the annoyance of guests). And Disney has doubled down on its app experience, which gives visitors a better sense of how long they should expect to wait in the park’s notoriously long lines. “They’ve made a lot of enhancements, and that’s helped us,” said Greg Antonelle, owner of MickeyTravels, an authorized Disney vacation planner. “You don’t necessarily need to be a Disney expert to figure some of these things out. They’ve tried to make the in-park experience straightforward for the guest.” Disney made other guest-friendly improvements in 2024. Related article25 of the USA’s most underrated destinations The parks relaxed reservation requirements and brought back Park Hopper access for guests who want to go to multiple theme parks in a single day. Disney let guests modify dining reservations up to two hours in advance; previously, visitors were locked in a day before the reservation was set. And guests can now make their Lightning Lane plans before the day of their visit, so they’re not futzing with their apps while they’re in the park. And the parks are working to clarify for guests when they can save money. Disney World announced it will offer up to 25% off on rooms early next year or $200 off per night for three-night guests who book a resort hotel stay. Disneyland has a $50 kids ticket offer for children up to 9 years old between January 7 and March 20. And both parks are offering deals for local residents and military members and veterans, too. An advantage of going during off-peak times: You might not need to purchase an expensive Lighting Lane pass for your favorite rides. During peak hours, they’re necessities if you don’t want to wait in a two- to three-hour line, but those lines can shrink to just 30 to 45 minutes during off-peak hours. Can you do a Disney trip for $25,000? You bet. And the company gets raked over the coals for it.Disney raising ticket priceshas become a symbol of corporate greed. Both Disney World (Florida) and Disneyland (California) tickets can cost more than $100 per person per day. The deals and enhanced visibility into how customers can save money could give some turned-off families reason to give Disney World or Disneyland a second look. And Disney would welcome that. The company announced in its latest financial report that foot traffic at US parks stalled outin recent quarters. Some inflation-weary travelers are looking to book more exotic getaways than a theme park if they’re going to be spending thousands of dollars on a family vacation. So Disney, like many other brands that have battled inflation, is emphasizing value, Antonelle noted. “We have some clients who stay at the club level at the Grand Floridian luxury resort for two weeks. And we have guests who stay at a value resort — and those people have just as much fun and make as many memories,” Antonelle said. “Disney gets some flak for their pricing, but there’s a lot of value you can get at Disney if you go at the right time.” Disney on a budget comes with some sacrifices: You won’t be able to go during peak vacation hours. You might have to take your children out of school for a few days during the week. January to March and September to November are the cheapest times to go, according to Jaimie Michaels, editor at Disney travel planning company MagicGuides. But just like there are a zillion options and price points when buying a car and you need to do some research to make sure you’re buying the right thing, a Disney vacation can be a similarly challenging purchase. Disney isn’t an impulse buy. Options and perks are constantly changing, and it’s best to come prepared. But Disney has heard the gripes, and it has reduced the amount of homework you need to do to go on a budget. And if you do, you can get a lot of bang for your buck. “You can go to a sporting event or Taylor Swift concert and spend a lot of money for two hours,” Antonelle said. “When you’re at Disney you can be in the park for 15 hours — and in that 15 hours, you can see a concert, play minigolf, you can see a parade and fireworks. … People just look at price, but not the value.”","Everyday, Society"

Try this one thing, and you’ll be heading in the right direction. Useful life advice can be found in unexpected places. And like most wisdom, it has a way of sticking around. In the pilot episode of the 1990s quirky cult TV show “Twin Peaks,” the lead character, FBI special agent Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan), walks into a diner with the local sheriff and orders two coffees. “I’m going to let you in on a little secret,” Cooper tells the sheriff. “Every day, once a day, give yourself a present. Don’t plan it. Don’t wait for it. Just let it happen. It could be a new shirt at the men’s store, a catnap in your office chair, or two cups of good, hot, black coffee.” “A present,” the sheriff replies, “like Christmas.” When I saw that, it sunk in deeper than most television dialogue; it’s essentially a philosophy about being mindful of the details in life we too often underappreciate. It’s not just an invitation to “treat yo’ self” (to borrow a catch phrase from another cult TV show, “Parks and Recreation”), but to recognize when you have done so.

Biden spent four years building up US alliances in Asia. Will they survive Trump’s next term?,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/asia/trump-us-alliances-asia-intl-hnk/,"For America’s friends in Asia, the uncertainty brought by the impending return of Donald Trump to the White House is coming at a bad time. China has been modernizing its military andnuclear arsenalwhile becoming increasingly aggressive in asserting territorial claims in the South China Sea and over Taiwan. North Korea hasramped up its belligerent rhetoricand calls to develop its illegal nuclear program. Both countries haveexpanded their alignment with Russiaas it wages war on Ukraine, linking Asia to the shattered peace in Europe. For decades, the US has backed the security of its allies in the region, which has more overseas active-duty American troops than anywhere else in the world. Tens of thousands of soldiers are stationed on sprawling bases in treaty allies South Korea and Japan, countries that, like the Philippines and Australia, the US is bound to aid if they come under attack. Those countries are now preparing for the return of an American leader who has railed against what he sees as free-riding US allies who don’t pay enough for defense,sidled up to autocrats, and called for an “America first” approach toglobal obligations. Many questions about Trump are on the minds of US-aligned leaders in Asia, observers across the region say. Will Trump ask for more defense spending than allies can afford? Could he take an extreme step to withdraw US forces if any such demands aren’t met? Will the businessman-turned-leader cut deals with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un or Russia’s Vladimir Putin that undermine the interests of US allies? Alternatively, could he perhaps strengthen US alliances and be a tougher opponent for America’s enemies? In the shadow of this uncertainty, leaders across the region have been scrambling to forge strong ties with the notoriously mercurial incoming US commander-in-chief, who’s known to link foreign policy to personal rapport. Many are warily eyeing President-elect Trump’sthreat to ringfence the world’s largest economywith 10% tariffs on all imports and upwards of 60% tariffs on goods from China, moves that could have significant economic knock-on effects across Asia. But as Trump’s January inauguration draws closer, governments across Asia are also facing potentially more existential questions about how Trump will manage US security relationships with friends and rivals – and stand by its allies if tested. After World War II, a network of US alliances was established across the world to serve as a powerful deterrent against another global war. A major aim was to prevent more countries from becoming nuclear powers by placing them under the umbrella of the US arsenal. In the eyes of many in Washington and across Asia, those alliances in Asia-Pacific have only become more critical as relationships in the region become more contentious. China hasexpanded its security tieswith NATO-adversary Russia and been accused ofenabling Moscow’s warby buying up Russian exports andproviding the dual-use goodsneeded for its defense base. Beijing has also ramped up itsintimidation of Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy it claims and has vowed to take control of, by force if necessary. In the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard has in recent months attacked Philippine ships withwater cannons and even axes, despite a major international ruling years ago denying its claim to the bulk of the strategically critical waterway. North Korea, meanwhile, hasramped up its threatstoward South Korea and the US as it carries outillegal weapons testing. It’s also aiding Russia’s war with ammunition, missiles, and – in amajor, recent escalation– soldiers, US officials say. But as Trump steps onto a more fraught and complex global stage than at the start of his first term eight years ago, observers in Asia say his focus appears to be on ratcheting up economic pressure on China rather than regionalsecurity. Related articleIndoctrinated, loyal and well trained: Don’t underestimate North Korean soldiers in Russia, some experts say Trump’s “priority is overwhelmingly on the economic relationship and on the United States not losing to China economically,” but there’s little sign “that he is deeply interested in the military or strategic balance in East Asia,” said Sam Roggeveen, director of the Lowy Institute’s International Security Program in Sydney. “Everything points in the opposite direction,” Roggeveen said. “He’s interested in – sure – having a strong military and defending the United States … but not in this idea of America as an indispensable power which has a unique global security role.” The incoming leader and his strategists have instead repeatedly questioned whether the US was getting enough out of its alliances and whether American lives should be lost and dollars spent fighting foreign wars. Trump shocked European leaders earlier this year bysaying he would encourage Russiato do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet the US-led alliance’s defense spending guidelines. Weeks before election day, Trump turned that spotlight toward Asia, claiming duringan interviewwith Bloomberg News that were he president, South Korea would pay $10 billion a year to host US troops — about eight times more than Seoul and Washington recently agreed on. South Korea already spends well over 2% of its gross domestic product on defense, considered by the US to be a benchmark for its allies. Over the past decade, the country has also paid 90% of the cost for expandingCamp Humphreys, the US’ largest overseas base. But Trump’s comments have sparked fears in Seoul that he could seek to renegotiate cost-sharing for US troops, despite afive-year agreementreached earlier this year that will raise Seoul’s spending to 8.3% more in 2026 than the previous year. A failed renegotiation – in a worst case posed by some observers – could result in a Trump decision to downsize or withdraw US forces meant to counter the threat from its belligerent northernneighbor. Such a scenario, or broader feelings that US commitment is waning, could also push Seoul toward developing its own nuclear arsenal – a potential first step on a slippery slope that could lead more middle powers to proliferate such weapons, experts say. But dealings with Trump have become a lot more complicated for South Korea. Lawmakers therevoted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeolearlier this month after his shock declaration of martial law, and then weeks later voted to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo. The country now faces months of political uncertainty at a time when observers have said building a strong leader-to-leader relationship is key. Related articleIt’s Texas 60 miles from North Korea: the US military’s largest overseas base “The biggest challenge is whether Seoul and Washington will be able to communicate properly,” said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. Such communication is key to “avert devastating consequences and surprises in the US-South Korea alliance that we currently assume would happen based on Trump’s harsh rhetoric against allies,” she added. In Japan, pundits have lamented the perceived deficiencies of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba compared with the late Shinzo Abe, known as Asia’s “Trump whisperer” for his finesse in getting close to the president-elect during his first term. The key American ally in Asia is likely to stress its own sweeping changes to its defense posture since Trump was last in power. Tokyo has veered away from the pacifist constitution imposed by the US in the aftermath of World War II, in 2022 moving toboost defense spendingto about 2% of its GDP by 2027 and buy up American cruise missiles. Countries throughout the region are also watching whether the Trump administration picks up the mantle of a key piece of Biden’s legacy: efforts to build across Asia what State Department officials have called a “lattice work” of interwoven US partnerships, part of the administration’s “invest, align, compete” strategy to counter Beijing. Biden bolstered theQuad(India, Japan, Australia and the US) security group and founded theAUKUS(Australia, United Kingdom and the US) partnership that aims to equip Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines. He also brokered significant increases in Japan’s security coordination with South Korea, the Philippines and Australia. Trump – as an unpredictable force in the White House – could drop, maintain or even deepen these relationships. But in the meantime, America’s Asian allies will look to hedge against any decline in US support. “The United States is now not the constant of international affairs, but rather the variable,” said Murata Koji, a professor of political science at Japan’s Doshisha University. “That’s why we have to expand our security (outside) the United States,” he said, pointing also to Tokyo’s need to deepen its partnership with Europe over shared concerns. That said, experts across the region broadly feel it’s unlikely there will be seismic changes in the US security presence under Trump, in terms of drawing down troops or tearing up alliance agreements, especially given American focus on the challenge posed by China. “Geopolitical realities and circumstances will oblige him to try to maintain forces in the region. The scenario that I’m thinking of is more of renegotiating, more than outright withdrawal,” said Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. And countries will not just be considering potential downsides to Trump’s return, Koh added, pointing to perceptions in Asia that Biden has hesitated in some of his decisions on Ukraine, complicating the situation for the besieged country. “With Trump coming in, there could be some renewed hope that (he) will not be like Biden in terms of crisis – maybe Trump will be more decisive,” he said. There are concerns, however, that an expected aggressive economic policy toward China could lead to a further breakdown in communication between the US and Chinese militaries, raising the risk of confrontation between the two. And if US allies are hurt by new American tariffs, they may have no choice but to rely more on the world’s second-largest economy. On the other hand, Trump also signaled some interest in working with China, implying inrecent commentsto CNBC that he saw at least certain aspects of his post-pandemic policy on China as “a step too far.” Then there is the question of how Trump deals with Taiwan – a potential flashpoint long seen as among the most likely triggers for a US-China conflict. Biden repeatedly broke with purposeful American ambiguity to say that the US would defend Taiwan if China invaded the island. He also approved funding for thefirst-ever military aidto the island as Beijing ramped up its military pressure. In contrast, the president-elect earlier this year appeared to undercut US relations with Taipei,claimingin a Bloomberg interview that Washington was “no different than an insurance company” for the island and said Taiwan should pay the US for defense. In October, hetoldthe Wall Street Journal he would impose 150% to 200% tariffs if China went “into Taiwan.” But how the Trump administration would react in the event of a contingency remains unknown. Trump’s choice for secretary of state, Sen. Marco Rubio, is a staunch advocate for the island, and his vice presidential pickJD Vance has arguedthat the US supplying Ukraine with air defense systems could hurt its ability to aid Taiwan’s defense if China were to attack. That argument, however, has observers in Asia concerned. Many in the region believe how Trump handles the war in Ukraine will send a critical message to Russia’s partners like China, Iran and North Korea – a set of nations some in Washington fear couldharden into a dangerous axis. Those concerns may be particularly acute when it comes to China, which has likely been watching closely as it looks to its own intentions in Taiwan. Related articleAs North Korea, Iran and China support Russia’s war, is a ‘new axis’ emerging? Trump has suggested he would end the Ukraine war “in 24 hours” and called for an “immediate ceasefire and negotiations” – a position that jives with Beijing’s stated stance on the war, which the US and its allies have criticized as being beneficial to Russia. “I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting!” Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social earlier this month. And what that rhetoric means in practice could have significant ramifications for Asia. “If Russia is allowed to walk away with looking like it’s got a win from this … that then cements this relationship (between Russia and China),” said Robert Ward, director of geo-economics and strategy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the UK. “And Xi Jinping will be watching this very closely, watching – how credible is Western deterrence? How credible is NATO? How willing is the West to actually put skin in the game in a conflict – and that of course relates back to Taiwan.” CNN’s Yoonjung Seo, Mike Valerio, and Hanako Montgomery contributed to this report.","Politics, World"
What is ‘Kessler Syndrome’ and why do some scientists think the space disaster scenario has already started?,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/27/science/space-junk-earth-kessler-syndrome/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. As a piece ofspaceborne garbageveered toward the International Space Station in November, the seven astronauts on board braced themselves. A Russian spacecraft attached to the space station lit its engines for five minutes, slightly tweaking the station’s trajectory and moving the football field-size laboratory out of harm’s way. If the space station had not changedcourse, the debris could have passed within 2 ½ miles (4 kilometers) of its orbital path, according toNASA. Related article‘Possibility of a catastrophic failure’: Inside the space station leak problem that has NASA worried Debris striking the space station could have spelled disaster. An impact might have depressurized segments of the station and left the astronauts scrambling to return home. What’s more concerning: The potential strike was not all that rare of an occurrence. The International Space Station has had to make similar maneuvers dozens of times since it was first occupiedin November2000, and collision risks are growing every year as the number of objects in orbit around Earth proliferate. Foryears, space traffic experts have raised alarm bells about the increasing congestion. Earlier collisions, explosions and weapons tests have resulted in tens of thousands of pieces of debris that experts are tracking and possibly millions more that cannot be seen with current technology. And while risks to astronauts may be a top concern, congestion in orbit is also hazardous to satellites and space-based technologies that power our everyday lives — including GPS tools as well as some broadband, high-speed internet and television services. “The number of objects in space that we have launched in the last four years has increased exponentially,” said Dr. Vishnu Reddy, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “So we are heading towards the situation that we are always dreading.” The event Reddy referred to is a hypothetical phenomenon called Kessler Syndrome. Named for American astrophysicist Donald Kessler and based on his 1978academic paper, Kessler Syndrome — as the term is used today — has amuddy definition. But the phrase broadly describes a scenario in which debris in space sets off a chain reaction: One explosion sends out a plume of fragments that in turn smash into other spaceborne objects, creating more detritus. The cascading effect may continue until Earth’s orbit is so clogged with junk that satellites become inoperable and space exploration must come to a grinding halt. Researchers disagree about the current level of risk and when, exactly, congestion in space may reach the point of no return. But there is widespread consensus about one thing: Traffic in space is a serious problem in desperate need of addressing, according to CNN interviews with scientists and space traffic experts. Since thedawn of spaceflightin 1957, there have been more than 650 “break-ups, explosions, collisions, or anomalous events resulting in fragmentation,” according to theEuropean Space Agency. Those incidents have included satellites that have accidentally collided with each other, rocket parts and spacecraft that have unexpectedly exploded, and weapons tests from nations including theUnited States,Russia,IndiaandChinathat have spewed detritus across various altitudes in orbit. Russia, for example, launched a missile at one of its own satellites as part of a weapons test in 2021, creating more than 1,500 traceable pieces of debris. The last major accidental collision between two spaceborne objects occurred in February 2009 when a dead Russian military satellite, called Kosmos 2251, rammed into Iridium 33, an active communications satellite operated by US-based telecommunications firm Iridium. That event produced a massive cloud of nearly2,000 piecesof debris that were nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter and thousands of even smaller pieces. Similar events on a smaller scale are also common: a US Air Force weather satellite, for example, broke apart in orbit on December 19, creating at least 50 new pieces of debris,LeoLabs, a company that tracks objects in space, said on Monday. It was only the latest ina string of four “fragmentation” eventsover the past few months that created more than 300 new pieces of litter. For those managing satellites, congestion in space can be a nightmare. It’s common for a satellite operator    to receive a dozen or more alerts per day about potential collisions. The process of tracking objects in orbit — called space situational awareness — involves tracing possible “conjunctions,” or close approaches between two entities. In one incidentthis year, for example, a NASA weather satellite narrowly missed colliding with a defunct Russian rocket by less than 65 feet (20 meters),according to LeoLabs. Related articleScientists have fiercely debated the existence of ‘Planet 9’ for a decade. Some say evidence is piling up But the risks may be even higher than what space situational awareness can predict. For the most part, an object must belarger than a tennis ballto be tracked. The remaining objects are too small to reflect light or in distant areas of orbit that are difficult to observe directly. “Even with today’s best sensors, there are limits to what can be reliably ‘seen’ or tracked, and smaller space debris is often untrackable,” said Bob Hall, director of special projects at COMSPOC Corp., a space traffic software company. But small objects can still pose significant threats. In orbit, objects whirl around so fast that even a fleck of paint is capable of smashing through metal, according toNASA. That means any piece of junk left in space is deeply concerning — and potentially catastrophic. Exactly how a chain reaction of collisions in space might play out is not clear. Different regions of Earth’s orbit have their own levels of congestion and risk. Low-Earth orbit, which extends to around 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers ) above the planet’s surface, is by far the most crowded. This area is home totwo crewed space stationsand massive constellations of satellites that beam internet — such as SpaceX’s network of nearly7,000 Starlink satellites— monitor weather, observe crop production or analyze the climate. If a ripple of explosions happened in low-Earth orbit, it could threaten astronauts’ lives, halt rocket launches and lead to the destruction of all the satellite technology present there. The good news in this scenario, if there is any, is that disastrous conditions may not last for generations to come: “We still have remnants of atmosphere in the low-Earth orbit, so we have a natural cleaning mechanism,” said Carolin Frueh, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University in Indiana. At an altitude of around 300 miles (500 kilometers), objects in orbit will naturally fall back to Earth or disintegrate in the atmosphere within about 25 years, Frueh said, indicating that a debris field at this distance likely would not threaten access to space for generations to come. But the picture changes rapidlyat higher orbits. At nearly 500 miles (800 kilometers), it would take at least a century for a piece of debris to be naturally dragged out of space. At more than 621 miles (1,000 kilometers), the process would take thousands of years. Related articleWhy scientists say we need to send clocks to the moon — soon That’s bad news for geosynchronous orbit — a region about 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) from Earth’s surface— which is home to quarter-billion-dollar communications satellites that beam TV and other services to broad swaths of the globe. “The most dangerous place where this (Kessler Syndrome-like event) could happen is in GEO,” said Reddy, the University of Arizona researcher. “Because we have no way of cleaning it up in a quick way.” The 2013 movie “Gravity” brought the idea of Kessler Syndrome to the big screen: A Russian missile strike on a dead satellite initiates a cascade of collisions, generating a cloud of junk that devastates other satellites and spacecraft. But while the drama in “Gravity” unfolded over an hour and a half, a real-life Kessler Syndrome scenario would likely take years — or decades — to play out, experts said. And since the film’s release more than a decade ago, congestion in orbit has rapidly increased: The US military was tracking about 23,000 objects then compared with47,000objects today. Though there are ongoing efforts to calculate where, when and how a ripple effect might kick off, it’s an impossible task, Purdue’s Frueh said. “As soon as we’re predicting into the future, we have to make assumptions,” Frueh said. “Every model is wrong — (but) some are useful.” Models are inaccurate because even experts do not have a pristine picture of where objects are in orbit. Objects smaller than about 4 inches (10 centimeters) are largely invisible. What’s more, space weather can change orbital trajectories — so it’s difficult to predict exactly how and where debris is traveling, according to Dr. Thomas Berger, director of the University of Colorado’s Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center. Berger spoke on the topic on December 11 at theAmerican Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in Washington, DC. The size and shape of spaceborne garbage pieces are also a mystery. So, to model a single Kessler Syndrome effect, analysts would have to guess exactly how a satellite would break apart, how each piece of that debris would look, where it would travel and what other object it might hit next. “What keeps me up,” said Dan Oltrogge, chief scientist and director of COMSPOC Corp.’s Center for Space Standards and Innovation,“is that the data is not accurate enough to allow you to actually avoid the thing you think you’re avoiding.” Given that “Kessler Syndrome” is not an instantaneous event, scientists are debating whether the phenomenon could already be in motion. Kessler’s thought experiment asks researchers to consider whether — even if all rocket launches ceased — collisions in space would still escalate the number of objects in orbit. And it’s not clear if that point has been reached. The researchers   interviewed for this story offered differing perspectives on whether events indicative of Kessler Syndrome had already kicked off. But Frueh said that’s why she no longer believes Kessler Syndrome is a useful term. “I think it’s confusing for the public that different entities do not agree,” she said. “The concept itself is just not as clean and crisp as you would think.” Related articleChinese rocket breaks apart in low-Earth orbit, creating a cloud of space debris, US Space Command says What experts do seem to agree on is that the situation in orbit is problematic. None said that they believed disaster could certainly be avoided. More likely, they said, the garbage in orbit will continue to proliferate. Frueh said, “I’m pessimistic … that we will act timely enough to not have economic damage in the process.” Dr. Nilton Renno, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan, said that he is optimistic by nature. But the situation in Earth orbit reminds him of the ecological woes underway here on our home planet. “The analogy that I like to think about space debris is plastic in the oceans,” he said. “We used to think that the oceans are infinite, and we throw in trash and plastic, and now we realize — no, those are finite resources. And we are causing huge damage if we are not careful about what we do.” There are two big considerations when talking about preventing the proliferation of debris in Earth’s orbit. One is cleanup technology: Companies and government initiatives are seeking to develop ways to drag debris out of orbit, such as the Drag Augmentation Deorbiting Subsystem, orADEO, developed by the European Space Agency and tech company High Performance Space Structure Systems, or HPS GmbH. The prototype braking sail was successfully deployed from the ION satellite inDecember 2022, according to ESA. The sail technology “provides a passive method of deorbiting by increasing the atmospheric surface drag effect,” an ESA release said, with the aim of causing a defunct satellite to descend more quickly and burn up in Earth’s atmosphere debris-free. These methods, however, are experimental and exceedingly expensive, Renno noted. And it’s not clear who would be willing to pay for them. The second consideration is regulation. Space policy experts have for years traced efforts to adopt new international guidelines or national laws aimed at preventing space companies or bad actors from acting irresponsibly. There are some efforts in the works. In September, the United Nations adopted thePact for the Future. The document, adopted by member states, includes an intention for nations to “discuss the establishment of new frameworks for space traffic, space debris and space resources through the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.” The language appears nebulous, and space policy experts point out that the United Nations has no means of enforcement. Perhaps more practical, Renno said, is for individual nations to adopt laws for space stakeholders. And he believes the United States should take a leadership role in that process. The University of Arizona’s Reddy agreed. “I think the biggest concern is the lack of regulation,” he said. “I think having some norms and guidelines that (are) put forward by the industry will help a lot.”",Science
AI bigwigs want to go all-in on nuclear. They also happen to be behind nuclear companies,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/24/tech/nuclear-energy-ai-leaders/,"Sam Altman is the chairman of a company that promises a brighter future for humankind. No, it’s not OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company he co-founded and now runs as CEO. It’s a company called Oklo, and it’s developing the kind of nuclear power technology that many tech leaders — including Altman himself — say they will need to fuel future artificial intelligence advancements. The proliferation of electricity-hungry data centers to power our digital lives – and increasingly, the AI technology that tech giants say is the future – now means that energy demand could soon outstrip supply. And that would be a problem for tech companies who are angling for their AI technology to revolutionize almost everything about the way we live and work. But while tech leaders have pointed to nuclear energy as essential to a climate friendly future, some industry experts wonder how much their investments will truly benefit the wider public, rather than just protecting their own businesses’ ability to operate. “I think the tech companies are looking out for their own interests, and whether those nuclear vendors are able to sell additional nuclear power plants for the public is another question,” said Sharon Squassoni, a research professor at George Washington University who’s studied nuclear energy and policy. Related articleSilicon Valley has a plan to save humanity: Just flip on the nuclear reactors It’s clear that more energy will need to come from somewhere. Electricity demand from US data centers has grown 50% since 2020 and now accounts for 4% of the country’s energy consumption; that figure could grow to 9% by 2030, UBS analysts said in a research note earlier this month. And overall power demand in the United States is expected to grow 13% to 15% a year until 2030, potentially turning electricity “into a much scarcer resource,”according to JPMorgan analysts. The electricity needs of data centers have alsothreatened to upendtech giants’ sustainability promises. Tech giants have pointed to the benefit of nuclear energy’s reliability versus other renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind. Microsoft in September secured a deal toreopen a reactoron Three Mile Island, the site of a 1979 partial meltdown in Pennsylvania, aiming to revive a different reactor by 2028 to power its AI ambitions.AmazonandMetahave also begun working to lock in deals to secure future nuclear power for their data centers. “Data centers operate 24/7 and they need a stable supply of electricity. They can’t shut down because the wind is not blowing or the sun is down,” said Anna Erickson, a professor at Georgia Tech who studies nuclear engineering. Oklo isn’t Altman’s only nuclear energy investment. The OpenAI CEOhas also invested in Helion Energy, a nuclear startup that’s using a different kind of technology from Oklo. Facebook co-founder and now Asana CEO Dustin Moskovitz, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Mithril, have also invested in Helion Energy. And Altman isn’t the only tech leader trying to cash in on the push toward nuclear. Separately, TerraPower, which is backed and chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, is in the early phases of building a new nuclear reactor in Wyoming. Google joined a $250 million funding round for nuclear startup TAE Technologies in 2022, and Amazonanchoreda $500 million financing round for nuclear startup X-energy in October. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has alsoinvestedin Canadian nuclear startup General Fusion. As of August, Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Mithril,owned 5.3%of Oklo’s shares, and the billionaire tech investor hasreportedly backedother nuclear startups. Tech investor Cathie Wood’s Ark Investalso investedin Oklo earlier this year. (President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for energy secretary, Chris Wright, chief executive of the fracking company Liberty Energy, also serves on Oklo’s board.) Already, lawmakers are lining up to support expanding nuclear power. President Joe Biden in July signed into law theAdvance Act, a bill designed to make it easier, cheaper and faster to permit and build new nuclear reactors that received bipartisan support. And during this year’sCOP28 climate talks, the United States joined more than 20 other countries inpledgingto triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Related articleThe US is on the cusp of a nuclear renaissance. One problem: Americans are terrified of the waste Some experts see the tech industry’s investment as crucial for pushing forward an expensive but clean energy source that could help combat climate change. “Let’s face it, these guys who are doing AI right now, they’re the ones with the money, right?” Erickson said. Megan Wilson, chief strategy officer at General Fusion, told CNN that “as we look at the interest by tech companies… in nuclear power, what we’re seeing is really a symptom of the broad recognition that we need clean, baseload power that is free of both carbon dioxide and methane emissions, that’s reliable and affordable.” Although General Fusion is still in the process of proving its technology works, Wilson added that fusion is expected to be an even safer option than fission, because it is combining atoms rather than separating them, and therefore is “very hard to start and very easy to stop.” In the future, the company expects its power plants “will have a radiation profile very similar to that of a hospital that uses medical isotopes or has a cancer treatment ward,” Wilson said. But some experts have raised concerns about heavy investments in nuclear by the leaders of an industry known for pushing back against regulations that could slow it down, even when it is intended to improve safety. “The problem here is that you have these Silicon Valley giants who have the clout, who have the power, to get a lot of what they want … and the industry’s attitude, first and foremost, is fight any regulation that would interfere with their plans,” said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “I am very concerned that the safety and security rules that are really essential for protecting the public could take a real beating,” Lyman said. A TerraPower spokesperson told CNN, “It’s clear that the world needs more carbon-free, reliable power; and advanced nuclear energy has an important role to play in helping both the public and private sectors meet decarbonization goals in the face of energy demand growing exponentially. Studies show that we will not make our net zero targets without nuclear energy in the mix; anyone serious about meeting carbon-free targets needs to be planning to integrate nuclear into their energy portfolio.” Oklo did not respond to requests for comment. Oklo, which was founded in 2013 by two MIT graduates, says it’s developing advanced nuclear reactors to “produce abundant, affordable, clean energy at a global scale.” The company’s name was inspired by the Oklo region in the African country of Gabon, wherescientists sayEarth’s only natural nuclear reactor existed some 2 billion years ago. Oklo is building so-called “fast reactors” that it says can create greater power output from less fuel — meaning they’resmaller and cheaper— and could recycle used nuclear fuel from other plants. It plans to sell power from those smaller reactors directly to customers, such as data center operators, potentially directly on-site. AI is expected to transform all of the technology we use in the coming decades, and “you want something that’s reliable and scalable and clean and (nuclear) fission is really well suited to do that,” Oklo CEO and co-founder Jacob DeWittesaid in May. Oklo’s stock has doubled since it began publicly trading in May following amergerwith Altman’sspecial purpose acquisition company, AltC Acquisition Corp. That strong stock performance comes as AI growth is expected to drive up demand for nuclear power, although Oklo isn’t yet making any money. But Oklo says it’s making progress toward its vision. The companyreceived approvalin September to begin site investigations for one of its small reactors in Idaho, and it says it’s reached several agreements to sell future power to data center operators. But so far, these small modular reactors are “all theory,” with a long and expensive road ahead to actually generating and selling power, according to Squassoni. Otherrecent US effortsto build new nuclear reactors have been plagued by delays and cost overruns. The United States also faceshurdles to accessing sufficient fuelto power new reactors, after restrictions on imports of enriched uranium from Russia began in the wake of its war in Ukraine. The US government is combing through its own nuclear stockpile to find enough fuel for some projects, while fuel enrichment efforts get off the ground. Gates’ TerraPower broke ground in June on its nuclear reactor “demonstration” plant, Natrium, which it hopes will be operational by 2030. For now, construction at the site in Kemmerer, Wyoming, is limited to non-nuclear elements, as it awaits full regulatory approval. TerraPower says its design is smaller and simpler than traditional nuclear reactors, and its system would use sodium for cooling, rather than traditional water-cooled reactors. The Wyoming plant is being built near a retiring coal power plant and is set toprovide powerto PacifiCorp, a utility company that has relied on the coal plant. Like Oklo’s design, TerraPower’s reactors will have “passive” safety mechanisms built in, the company says. This means they’re designed to automatically cool down if something goes wrong, enabling them to avoid the kinds of catastrophes associated with the industry, like the 1986 Chernobyl accident. Gates has said he founded — and invested more than $1 billion into — TerraPower because he believes expanding nuclear energy generation is essential to combat climate change. “This is a big step toward safe, abundant, zero-carbon energy,” Gates said at the Wyoming plant’sgroundbreaking ceremonyin June. “It’s important for the future of this country that projects like this succeed.” But TerraPower and other nuclear startups still have some way to go in convincing the public that their next-generation designs aren’t just feasible, but also safe. “The industry has been pushing for loosening regulations, speeding up processes, and the Trump administration undoubtedly will try to speed things up and reduce some regulations,” Squassoni said. Gates commented on nuclear safety concerns in aJune interviewwith NPR, saying the company welcomes regulatory scrutiny. “The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is the best in the world, and they’ll question us and challenge us. And, you know, that’s fantastic,” he said. –CNN’s Allison Morrow and Ella Nilsen contributed to this report.","Technology, Business"
US stocks fall with one trading day left in 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/investing/stock-selloff-dow/,"US stocks dropped Monday, with the Dow falling by more than 300 points as markets close out a record year. The S&P 500 fell by 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq saw the biggest slide, down 1.1%, as traders sold off Big Tech investments such as Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). Shares of Boeing (BA) also saw major declines Monday following thefatal Jeju Air crash, which prompted South Korea to order an inspection of all its 737-800 planes, the Boeing model that crashed. Boeing’s stock was down over 2% on the news. Bitcoin’smassive late-year rallyalso continued to fizzle Monday, trading at $92,000. The cryptocurrency surged to $106,000 earlier this month on hopes that the upcoming administration will espouse more crypto-friendly policies. In the commodities market, natural gas prices leapt by 20% Monday to a nearly two-year high as energy markets brace for a cold blast that could simultaneously spike demand and curb supply. The shortened trading week due to observance of the New Year, along with thin volume, can amplify market volatility, giving active buyers and sellers an outsized impact. Plus, end-of-year trading moves where traders generally try to pocket gains while often selling losing investments to offset them can help push stocks down. But even prior to the holiday period, the Dow experienced itslongest daily losing streaksince 1974. The losses worsened after the Federal Reserve meeting earlier this month. While the central bank delivered a much-anticipated quarter-point rate cut, officials lowered their outlook for the number of rate cuts they expect to happen next year, resulting in a massive selloff. Still, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all on track to book another year of gains. Of the three, the Nasdaq is set to see the biggest gains of the year, up more than 31% as of Monday morning. Looking ahead to next week, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are set to close on Thursday, January 9, as part of a National Day of Mourning to honor former President Jimmy Carter, who willreceive a state funeralin Washington, DC, that day.

So you want to get your financial life in order in 2025. Here’s what to do,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/health/financial-new-year-resolutions-list-wellness/,"So you want to get your financial life in order. And you swear that 2025 will betheyear you do it. In fact, you’re making it your new year’s resolution. It’s a fine idea. No, really. It is. But you might meet with more success bynotmaking such a sweeping, vague promise to yourself. Instead, resolve to do just one or two specific things that will start to improve your financial life. Aiming high is great, but focusing on a few manageable steps toward a concrete goal is more likely to get you where you want to go. Why? Because once you achieve those smaller to-dos, you’re more likely to build on the momentum. So here are some more specific goals to choose from — and simple steps you can take to meet them. Step 1: Figure out what you owe.“People’s big mistake is that they don’t know what they owe because they’re too afraid to look. Fear makes the wolf bigger than it is,” said personal finance educator Tiffany Aliche, founder of TheBudgetnista.com. If this is you, find yourself an accountability partner, preferably a non-judgy one, like a goodfriend. And let that person review your statements — maybe even read them out loud to you. Then write down the following: Who do you owe? How much do you owe them? What’s the interest rate? What’s the status of your account (e.g., When are payments due? Have you missed any? What are the penalties?) Step 2: Pick a pay-down strategy that best suits you.Aliche offers three options to choose from: The snowball, the avalanche and the blizzard. With the snowball strategy, you list your debts from lowest to highest, and commit to pay the minimum on all but the smallest one. That’s the debt you will aim to pay off first by consistently paying more than the minimum owed. Related articleHow to capitalize on the Fed’s final interest rate cut of the year Once it is paid off, take the payments you had been applying to that small debt and apply them to your second-lowest debt. Then repeat the same pattern until all your debts are cleared. With the avalanche strategy, list your debts in order of highest to lowest interest rates. Again, commit to pay at least the minimum owed on all of them except for your highest-rate debt. That’s the debt you will pay off first. Once that’s done, apply the payments you’d been making on that one to your debt with the second highest rate. And so on. Using the blizzard strategy, you list your debts by how much stress they cause you. Your goal is first to pay down the debt that stresses you out the most — say, a loan from a family member if it’s getting in the way of your relationship. “Most people are snowball people,” Aliche said. “And then they switch to avalanche.” Or, she said, if stress is your thing, you might start with blizzard, then move to snowball and finish with avalanche. Increasing your income is everyone’s favorite idea. Your best starting place is your current job. “Create a brag book or what you might call a Go-Me File,” Aliche said. Use it to write down your accomplishments, and the accolades you get from others at work or from clients.Then quantify how your efforts on the job made or saved the company money. This will build your case for why you deserve a raise. “You’re not asking for more money. You’re displaying your value,” Aliche said, noting that you’re showing your managers what the company will lose if you leave. Say you’ve generated or saved $50,000 to $100,000. That is the context in which you put your request for a $5,000 to $10,000 raise. In this way, your manager is more likely to conclude they ought to pay you more, she said. If you get turned down, you now have a great resource to use on your job hunt, which might take several months. Another way to make extra money in 2025 is toidentify what Aliche calls your “pocket-size hustle” — which is something you can pull out of your pocket when needed. It’s either related to what you’re currently doing or to something in which you have a degree or license so you can charge more, she explained. For example, when she was a full-time teacher, she would babysit and tutor for extra cash. It’s usually hard to save more money unless you find ways to spend less of it. If you don’t like the idea of making a budget, set up guardrails that will make it easy to pay your bills, make it hard to overspend and make it possible to set aside necessary savings. This is what Aliche terms the “split it before you get it” strategy. Related articleWhat the new 401(k) limits and other changes mean for your retirement After setting aside some pretax earnings to go intoyour 401(k)— ideally, enough to get your employer’s full match — have your payroll department automatically deposit your after-tax money into four different accounts. Bill-paying checking account:The first slice goes into a no-cost checking account that is strictly used to automatically pay your recurring monthly expenses, like housing, utilities and child care plus whatever recurring debt payments you have set up from the debt section above. Do not have a debit card for this account.“You don’t want to accidentally swipe your card and use your bill money,” Aliche said. For surprise bills that come up, you might commit to a given day in the month (eg, the third Thursday or the 15th) to manually pay them, and if need be, transfer money into that account from your savings to cover them. Debit-card account:The next portion of your paycheck gets automatically deposited into a second checking account, which will serve as your debit card account from which you will draw money for everyday cash purchases. Emergency savings account:The third account should be an online high-yield savings account for your emergency fund money, with the goal of having at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses. Savings goals account:Thendirect the rest of your paycheck to another online high-yield savings account that is earmarked for goals you want to reach in the next one to five years — such as a big trip or a down payment. If you’re not sure where to start — or just not sure how to attack something that is not on this list but is important to you (e.g., coming up with an estate plan), here are a few ways to move in the right direction in the first quarter of the new year: Take baby steps:To make progress toward any financial goal, commit to spending as little as an hour every week or even every month on it, said certified financial planner Jaime Eckels, apartner at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. In between those times, observe and write down your financial behaviors or worries. For example, Eckels said, pay attention when you go to a store like Target. Do you always go in for one or two things but come out with four or five others that aren’t essential? What  financial concerns, if any, have been gnawing at you and does anything specific trigger that feeling? Write down what you want:Deciding what’s important to you, and writing down a goal, as well as steps and deadlines to move you toward achieving it, can help motivate you to stay on track once you get started. Ask for help:“If you don’t know what you need to do and don’t know how to prioritize, get help. Find a family member or friend to help you get your arms around what needs to be done,” Eckels said. Indeed, when it comes to accomplishing most financial goals, “Accountability is the true hack,” said Aliche, who is running a freeGet Good with Money Challenge, a week-long online event starting January 6. And don’t be afraid to seek help from a lawyer or accountant if there are legal ortaxissues you don’t understand. But be sure to write your questions in advance, Eckels advised, so you get what you need and don’t have to pay for their time while you come up with all your questions on the spot. Reward yourself:Whatever financial goals you decide to address in 2025, be sure to celebrate the small wins along the way, Eckels said. “Set a reward for yourself – a small something that’s meaningful.” Which for some people actually might be that cute little thing from Target.

Rolex stolen from Keanu Reeves’ LA home turns up in Chile,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/28/entertainment/keanu-reeves-rolex-john-wick-chile-intl-latam/,"Police in Chile say they have recovered three watches belonging to “John Wick” star Keanu Reeves – including a $9,000 Rolex – that are thought to have been stolen from the actor’s Los Angeles home in late 2023. The Rolex Submariner watch – engraved with the actor’s first name and the words, “2021, JW4, thank you, The John Wick Five” – was recovered Saturday in eastern Santiago during a police operation linked to a series of local robberies. In 2021, Reeves reportedly gifted Rolex Submariners to the stuntmen he worked with on “John Wick: Chapter 4.” The watch has a price of around $9,000, according to Rolex’swebsite. Ironically, the “John Wick” saga starts with Reeves’ character – a former hitman – seeking revenge after his home is broken into, robbed and his dog killed. Chilean authorities said they had found jewelry and “valuable” watches during raids on four houses, with at least one of the timepieces “belonging to a famous actor who was victim of a robbery in Los Angeles in December 2023.” CNN Chile, citing local police, reported that a total of three watches recovered in the raids belong to the actor. It said Chilean authorities were working with US officials on the case and that this had helped them link the watch to the 2023 burglary at the actor’s home. Police said they have arrested a 21-year-old man. CNN has reached out to Reeves’ representatives for comment. The actor has been the victim of home robberies several times.

"The comb jelly, one of the oldest animals on Earth, can fuse with another",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/science/comb-jellies-fuse-single-organism/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Late one summer night in 2023, Kei Jokura entered the marine biology lab at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts excitedly carrying a blob in a beaker. The biologist had just come from the first floor, where tanks held a colony of gelatinous comb jellies. The blob was bigger than others, and it looked as though two of the jellies had merged into one. “I couldn’t believe my eyes at first,” recalled Jokura, who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the UK’s University of Exeter. Related articleThe longest-living vertebrate could offer clues to extending the human lifespan, scientists say Mariana Rodriguez-Santiago, a postdoctoral researcher at Colorado State University, was working on her own project when Jokura appeared. “We were all amazed and astonished, thinking, ‘How can they fuse and still be swimming and moving around like a unit?’” she said. She grabbed a pipette and gently poked one of the jellies. It squirmed. Simultaneously, so did the one to which it seemed to be attached. “We thought, ‘Are they able to feel the same thing? Are they one individual? Two individuals? How can we disentangle this?’” she recalled. Over the next few weeks, Rodriguez-Santiago helped Jokura combine multiple pairs of the comb jellies, scientifically known as Mnemiopsis leidyi, to see what happened. The findings of the investigation led by Jokura, published October 7 in the journalCurrent Biology, showed that not only could two jellies fuse their bodies, but their nervous and digestive systems fused as well. Two effectively became one. “The fusion phenomenon has definitely brought up many interesting questions, such as which genes are involved in fusion, what happens to neural signaling, and what defines ‘self’ and ‘nonself,’” said Jokura, now a postdoctoral researcher at Japan’s National Institute for Basic Biology. “Each of these themes has the potential to challenge our fundamental understanding of biology.” Comb jelliesare found all around the world in coastal waters and the deep ocean. Though they look similar to jellyfish, they don’t sting and belong to a different phylum,Ctenophora, which is Greek for “comb-bearers.” They are named for their combs, rows of hairlike appendages called cilia they use to move through the water. Related articleSurprising jellyfish finding challenges what’s known about learning and memory Ctenophores are one of, if not the, oldest animals on Earth — quite possibly asister to all other animals in the tree of life, so “they provide a really unique opportunity to study fundamental aspects of nervous system function,” said Rodriguez-Santiago, coauthor of the study. “They belong to a group of animals which were there when the very first animals evolved,” said Pawel Burkhardt, an evolutionary biologist and researcher at the University of Bergen in Norway. Burkhardt was coauthor of another October report on M. leidyi, published in the journalPNAS, showing that the jelly is able to develop backward, reverting to an earlier life stage following stress. He was not involved in the study that appeared in Current Biology. “The two recent papers highlight that ctenophores have the opportunity to adapt quickly to changing environments and that their developmental programs are potentially more flexible than seen in other animals,” he said. It also may be, Jokura’s paper suggests, that ctenophores lack the protective allorecognition mechanism that allows one organism to tell the difference between its own cells and tissues and those of another organism. In humans, for example, allorecognition underpins the organ rejection that happens in transplant surgeries. Jokura was studying how M. leidyi responds to light when he discovered two injured specimens had become conjoined. Curious to recreate the phenomenon, he and Rodriguez-Santiago began experimenting. They sliced off parts of several jellies and placed excised pairs together in petri dishes overnight. Nine out of 10 pairs fused successfully, resulting in animals with two sensory organs and two sets of anal openings, whereas typical jellies have only one of each. As it turned out, the fusion happened much more quickly than the researchers expected, according to Jokura. “To observe the fusion process — when and how it happens — we performed time-lapse imaging,” he said. The research team placed cut jellies near each other and waited. At first, the jellies continued to contract their muscles independently. Within an hour, their rhythmic movements started to synchronize. By the two-hour mark, they were in sync. When poked gently on one side, both sides of the combined organism contracted in unison. Imaging demonstrated another layer to the fusion: The animals’ digestive systems also combined. The researchers fed a fluorescently labeled brine shrimp into one mouth of a pair of jellies that had been fused for two days. Then the team traced the meal’s movement through a microscope. The digested particles traveled down the digestive canal, crossed the fusion boundary and entered into the digestive tract of the other animal — “and the other individual could poop out the food,” Rodriguez-Santiago explained. Eventually, the waste was expelled by both anuses, each in its own time. What Rodriguez-Santiago finds most interesting about the study is the way it calls into question what she thought of as “pretty hard boundaries” between self and other. Allorecognition is considered a protective adaptation because it enables a body to reject foreign cells that could introduce dangerous diseases. But these animals “bypass that sensory rejection to then potentially have an even better chance of survival,” she said. Burkhardt believes the findings may lead scientists toward an understanding of when animals evolved allorecognition and how simple nervous systems form and process information.

Scientists have fiercely debated existence of ‘Planet 9’ for a decade. Some say the evidence is piling up,https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/science/planet-nine-kuiper-belt-latest-evidence/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Our solar system used to have nine planets. Astronomer Mike Brown, also known as “the man who killed Pluto,” said he got hate mail from kids and obscene calls at 3 a.m. for years after his most famous finding helped change that. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at Caltech, discovered another small world called Eris in the Kuiper Belt — a vast ring of icy objects beyond Neptune’s orbit that also happens to be the former ninth planet’s neighborhood. The 2005 revelation set off a chain of events that led toPluto’s still-controversial demotionfrom planet status the following year. But now, just as the Kuiper Belt effectively took a ninth planet away, Brown and other scientists believe it could give one back. The belt, which astronomers believe is made of leftovers from the solar system’s formation, extends 50 times farther from the sun than Earth, with a secondary region that reaches beyond it for nearly 20 times that distance. Pluto, now classified as adwarf planetalong with Eris, is just one of the largest among the scores of icy bodies that exist there — and doesn’t dominate its own orbit and clear the orbit of other objects. That’s why it can’t have the same standing as the remaining eight planets, according toguidelineslaid out by the International Astronomical Union. Because objects in the Kuiper Belt are so far away from the sun, however, they are difficult to spot. For more than a decade, astronomers have been searching that area for a hidden planet that has never been observed, but its presence is inferred by the behavior of other nearby objects. It’s often called Planet X or Planet Nine. “If we find another planet, that is a really big deal,” said Malena Rice, an assistant professor of astronomy at Yale University. “It could completely reshape our understanding of the solar system and of other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It’s really exciting — there is a lot of potential to learn a tremendous amount about the universe.” The excitement comes with some controversy — different camps have competing theories about the planet itself while some researchers believe it doesn’t exist at all. “There are definitely full-blown skeptics about Planet Nine — it’s kind of a contentious topic,” Rice said. “Some people feel very passionately that it exists. Some people feel very passionately that it doesn’t. There’s a lot of debate in trying to pin down what it is, and whether it’s there. But that’s the hallmark of a really interesting topic, because otherwise people wouldn’t have heated opinions about it.” Soon, the debate could be settled, once a new telescope capable of surveying the entire available sky every few nights comes online in late 2025. Until then, a team of researchers believes it has found the most compelling evidence yet that the hidden planet is real. The search for Planet Nine has only recently kicked into gear, but the discussion about its existence dates back more than 175 years. “Since Neptune was successfully discovered in 1846, at least 30 astronomers have proposed the existence of various types of trans-Neptunian planets — and they’ve always been wrong,” said Konstantin Batygin, a colleague of Brown’s who is also a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology. Any body orbiting the sun beyond the orbit of Neptune is defined as “trans-Neptunian” by astronomers. “I never thought I would be talking about how there’s evidence for a trans-Neptunian planet, but I believe that unlike all of those previous times, in this case, we’re actually right,” he added. Batygin and Brown are among the most vocal supporters of Planet Nine. The pair has been actively working on finding the hidden planet since 2014, inspired by a study by astronomers Scott Sheppard, staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC, and Chadwick Trujillo, associate professor of astronomy and planetary sciences at Northern Arizona University. Sheppard and Trujillo were the first tonoticethat the orbits of a handful of known trans-Neptunian objects were all strangely clustered together. The duo argued that anunseen planet— several times larger than Earth and more than 200 times our planet’s distance from the sun — could be “shepherding” these smaller objects. “The most visually striking evidence remains the earliest: that the most distant object(s) beyond Neptune all have orbits (that) point in one direction,” Brown said in an email. Batygin has since coauthored half a dozen studies on Planet Nine, offering several lines of evidence about its existence. The strongest, he said, is in his latest work, coauthored by Brown and two other researchers and published in April inThe Astrophysical Journal Letters. The study tracks icy bodies subject to some kind of perturbation that’s injecting them into the orbit of Neptune before they leave the solar system entirely. “If you look at these bodies, their lifetimes are tiny compared to the age of the solar system,” Batygin said. “That means something is putting them there. And so what can it be?” One option could be something called galactic tide, a combination of forces exerted by distant stars in the Milky Way galaxy. But Batygin and his team ran computer simulations to test this scenario versus the presence of Planet Nine, and they found that a solar system without the hidden planet is “strongly refuted by the data.” “That’s a really remarkable smoking gun. And it’s obvious in retrospect, so I feel a little embarrassed that it took us almost a decade to figure this out. Better late than never, I suppose,” Batygin said. Related article‘Dyson spheres’ were theorized as a way to detect alien life. Scientists say they’ve found potential evidence Planet Nine, according to Batygin, is a “super-Earth” object, about five to seven times the mass of our planet, and its orbital period is between 10,000 and 20,000 years. “What I cannot calculate from doing simulations is where it is on its orbit, as well as its composition,” Batygin said. “The most mundane explanation is that it’s kind of a smaller version of Uranus and Neptune, and probably one of the cores that participated in the formation process of those planets.” The super-Earth hypothesis is perhaps the one that gets the most support among Planet Nine believers, but competing theories present alternative explanations. Astudypublished in August 2023 proposes the existence of a hidden planet that’s actually much smaller, with a mass between 1.5 and 3 times that of Earth. “It’s possible that it’s an icy, rocky Earth, or a super-Pluto,” said Patryk Sofia Lykawka, an associate professor of planetary sciences at Kindai University in Japan and coauthor of the study. “Because of its large mass, it would have a high internal energy that could sustain, for example, subsurface oceans. Its orbit would be very distant, much beyond Neptune, and much more inclined if compared to the known planets — even more inclined than Pluto’s, whose inclination is about 17 degrees,” Lykawka said. (Astronomers refer to a planet’s orbit as inclined when it’s not on the same plane as Earth’s.) Related articleA supernova first seen in 1181 is releasing glowing filaments The presence of the planet is derived from computational models meant to explain the strange behaviors of populations of trans-Neptunian objects, which suggests similarities with Batygin’s research. However, Lykawka pointed out, his model does not look at the same orbital alignments and is very different from Batygin’s. That’s why he doesn’t refer to the mystery object as Planet Nine but “Kuiper Belt planet” instead, to “make it clear that we are talking about different hypothetical planets,” he explained. Other theories propose that the anomalies everyone’s trying to explain are due to something else entirely, such as aprimordial black hole— created just after the big bang — that our solar system captured as it moved across the galaxy. Anotherideasuggests that there might be something wrong with science’s current understanding of gravity. But according to Rice of Yale University, these theories would be very difficult to test. “There are lots of other ideas, but I usually try to go with Occam’s razor when it comes to deciding what to prioritize in terms of checking,” she said, citing a classic principle of philosophy that states that among competing ideas, the simplest is usually correct. “In terms of scientific viability, we know that there are eight planets already, so it’s not so crazy to have another planet within the same system.” The most promising path forward, she added, is actually finding more of the trans-Neptunian objects that Batygin is basing his hypothesis on — and proving that it’s statistically significant that their orbits are clustered. Some researchers believe that currently scientists have detected too few of these distant trans-Neptunian objects to draw any conclusions about their orbits. “We have about roughly a dozen or so of these objects,” said Renu Malhotra, regents professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona, “but we observe only the brightest ones, and only a tiny fraction of even those, because we observe them when they are at their closest approach to the sun.” The data suffers from observational bias, according to Malhotra, which is why researchers are skeptical about it. Among the skeptics is Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science, one of the coauthors of the 2014 study that inspired Batygin’s research. “By now, we expected to have found many more of these extreme trans-Neptunian objects,” Sheppard said in an email. “Having several tens of them would allow us to reliably determine if they are truly clustered in space or not. But unfortunately we are still in the small-number statistics realm, because they are much rarer than first thought. Right now I would say it’s possible there is a super-Earth planet in the distant solar system, but we cannot say that with a lot of confidence.” The controversy can get heated, according to Malhotra. “Scientists come in different personality types, just like everybody else. Some are more aggressive about their science, while others are more measured,” she said. “There is a perception that the idea of a Neptune-mass Planet Nine is being pushed more aggressively than the statistics justify.” Malhotra coauthored anAugust 2017 papersuggesting the presence of a Mars-size planet in the Kuiper Belt, but she’s not ruling out the Planet Nine hypothesis entirely. Related articleAging spacecraft starts up a radio transmitter it hasn’t used since 1981 from 15 billion miles away “It’s up in the air. It’s just at the edge of statistical significance,” she said. ”But there’s nothing in the physics we know and the observations we have that rules out the possibility of large planets at tens of times the distance of Neptune from the sun.” Observing the planet directly would, of course, end all controversy, but every attempt so far has come up empty. Batygin coauthored aMarch studythat used data from the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, or Pan-STARRS, observatory in Hawaii, allowing researchers to analyze 78% of the sky where Planet Nine supposedly could be — but they couldn’t find it. “It’s been a real slog,” he said about the attempt, citing the difficulty of having to work with telescopes over just a few days of allotted time while fighting against equipment breakages and adverse weather. Spotting such a distant object without knowing where to look is exceedingly hard, and akin to searching for a target with a sniper rifle instead of binoculars, according to Batygin. “The sky is a really, really big place when you’re looking for something so painfully dim,” he said. “This thing is something like 100 million times less bright than Neptune — that’s really pushing towards the edge of what’s possible with the absolute largest telescopes in the world right now.” Other searches, such as one performed for aDecember 2021study using the Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile, have also come up short. “I had to test tens of thousands of different orbits. In the end I didn’t spot anything,” said the study’s lead author Sigurd Naess, a researcher at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics of the University of Oslo in Norway. The instrument’s sensitivity, he added, was good enough that it should have been able to detect a planet in an area between 300 and 600 times the distance between Earth and the sun. “That’s enough to be informative, but far from enough to disprove Planet Nine as a whole,” Naess said in an email. Amid controversies and diverging opinions, all of the researchers agree on one thing. A new wide-angle telescope currently under construction could soon put the debate to rest, once the US National Science Foundation and Stanford University researchers start scientific operations in late 2025. Called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, it has thelargest digital cameraever built and sits atop an 8,800-foot mountain in northern Chile. “This is a next-generation telescope that will search the entire available sky every few days,” Batygin said. “It might just find Planet Nine directly, which would be a fantastic conclusion to the search and open up a new chapter. At the very least, it will find a ton more Kuiper Belt objects. But even if it doesn’t discover a single new object, it will be enough to confirm the Planet Nine hypothesis, because it will test all of the statistics, all of the patterns that we see with an independent survey.” Rice agrees that the telescope will go a long way to settling the debate, and clearly address the question of the statistical significance of the alignment of trans-Neptunian objects — the key point of evidence for Planet Nine. If the Rubin telescope finds a super-Earth, Rice said, that would be exciting because these celestial bodies, between the sizes of Earth and Neptune, are a common type of exoplanet. “We do not have one in the solar system, which seems really strange, and has kind of been an outstanding mystery because we find so many of them in systems around other stars — it would be incredible to actually study one up close, because exoplanets are so far away that it’s very difficult to get a real grasp on exactly what they physically look like,” Rice said. Related articleMission to study the ‘dark side’ of the universe just revealed the first piece of unprecedented map Finding a smaller planet would also spark excitement, Rice added, because every solar system planet is immensely useful for extrapolating information about the thousands of comparable exoplanets that researchers are uncovering across the galaxy. And what if nothing shows up at all? It would still be useful to know for sure how many planets there are, Rice said. “I think not even knowing the number of planets in our own solar system is very humbling.” That means that even the facts that many people learned from textbooks as children can change, as scientists discover more about the universe. “That’s actually a wonderful thing,” she added. “Human knowledge is continually moving — sometimes it’s huge shifts, sometimes it’s just a back-and-forth debate. It’s a fun, emblematic example of the scientific process.”",Science
History-making probe achieves closest-ever approach to the sun,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/science/parker-solar-probe-sun-close-approach/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. The Parker Solar Probe zoomed by the sun on Tuesday during a record-breaking flyby, coming within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the solar surface during humanity’s closest approach to a star. The mission operations team, located at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, was able toconfirm the success of the flybyFriday morning after receiving a signal from the spacecraft just before midnight on Thursday. The mission team knew it wouldn’t receive any communications from the spacecraft during its closest pass of the sun. Now, the team members will await more detailed data from Parker about the spacecraft’s status that’s expected to return to Earth on January 1. The uncrewed spacecraftflew at 430,000 miles per hour (692,000 kilometers per hour), which is fast enough to reach Tokyo from Washington, DC, in under a minute, according to NASA. The speedy flyby would make the probe the fastest human-made object in history, the agency shared December 16 during a NASA Science Live presentation on YouTube. The mission has been building up to this historic milestone sinceit launchedon August 12, 2018 — an event attended by the probe’s namesake, Dr. Eugene Parker, an astrophysicist who pioneered the solar research field of heliophysics. Parker was the first living person to have a spacecraft named after him. The astrophysicist, whose research revolutionized humanity’s understanding of the sun and interplanetary space,died at age 94in March 2022. But he was still able to witness how the spacecraft could help solve mysteries about the sun more than 65 years after the mission was originally envisioned. The probe became the first spacecraft to “touch the sun” by successfully flying through the sun’s corona, or upper atmosphere, to sample particles and our star’s magnetic fields in December 2021. Over the past six years of the spacecraft’s seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe has collected data to enlighten scientists about some of the sun’s greatest mysteries.Heliophysicists have long wondered how the solar wind, a constant stream of particles released by the sun, is generated as well as why the sun’s corona is so much hotter than its surface. Scientists also want to understand how coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere, are structured. When these ejections are aimed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of the planet’s magnetic field, that can affect satellites as well as power and communication infrastructure on Earth. Now, the time has come for Parker’s closest and final flybys, which could complete the answers to these enduring questions and uncover new mysteries by exploring uncharted solar territory. “Parker Solar Probe is changing the field of heliophysics,” said Helene Winters, Parker Solar Probe’s project manager from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, in a statement. “After years of braving the heat and dust of the inner solar system, taking blasts of solar energy and radiation that no spacecraft has ever seen, Parker Solar Probe continues to thrive.” Parker’s flyby at around 6:53 a.m. ET on Christmas Eve was planned as the first of the spacecraft’s final three closest approaches, with the other two expected to occur on March 22 and June 19. The spacecraft came so close to our star that if the distance between Earth and the sun were the length of an American football field, the spacecraft would be about 4 yards from the end zone, according to NASA. At this proximity, the probe would be able to fly through plumes of plasma as well as within a solar eruption if one releases from the sun. The spacecraft was built to withstand the extremes of the sun and has flown through coronal mass ejections in the past with no impact to the vehicle, said Parker Solar Probe project scientist Nour Rawafi. The spacecraft is equipped with a carbon foam shield that is 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) thick and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide. On Earth before launch, the shield was tested and able to withstand temperatures near 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 1,400 degrees Celsius). On Christmas Eve, the shield likely facedtemperatures up to 1,800 F (980 degrees C), which the telemetry data expected in January will confirm. Meanwhile, the spacecraft’s interior is at a comfortable room temperature so the electronics systems and science instruments can operate as expected. A unique cooling system designed by the Applied Physics Laboratory pumps water through the craft’s solar arrays to keep them at a steady temperature of 320 F (160 C), even during close approaches to the sun. The spacecraft carried out its flyby autonomously because mission control was out of contact with the probe due to its proximity to the sun. The immense set of data and images gathered during the flyby won’t become available to mission control until Parker has moved away from the sun in its orbit, which will occur about three weeks later in mid-January, Rawafi said. Just over a year after the Parker Solar Probe first launched, the sunentered a new solar cycle. Now, the sun is experiencing solar maximum, meaning that the mission has had a chance to witness most of a solar cycle and the transitions between its highs and lows, said Dr. C. Alex Young, associate director for science in the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Scientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced in October that the sun has reached solar maximum, or the peak of activity within its 11-year cycle. At the peak of the solar cycle, the sun’s magnetic poles flip, causing the sun to transition from calm to active. Experts track increasing solar activity by counting how many sunspots appear on the sun’s surface. And the sun is expected to remain active for the next year or so. The sun’s increasing activity became obvious this year during two major displays of auroras on Earth inMayandOctober, when coronal mass ejections released by the sun were directed at our planet. The solar storms are also responsible for generating auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. “Both of those storms caused auroras to be visible down to the very bottom of the United States,” Young said. “But the May storm was an especially strong storm. In fact, we think it could be a 100- to possibly 500-year event, and that caused auroras very close to the equator, which is extremely unheard of. It was a worldwide event that millions and, hopefully billions, of people, were able to see, and it may not happen again.” The data gathered by Parker Solar Probe could enable scientists to better understand solar storms and even how to predict them, Young said. “The sun is the only star that we can see in detail, but we can actually go to and measure it directly,” Young said. “It’s a laboratory in our solar system that allows us to learn about all the other stars in the universe and how all those stars interact with the billions and billions of other planets that may or may not be like our own planets in our solar system.” With that in mind, Rawafi said he hopes that the sun puts on a spectacular show during the probe’s close approaches, enabling scientists to gain insights into the sun’s activity. “Sun, please do your best,” Rawafi said. “Give us the strongest event you can do, and the Parker Solar Probe can deal with it.”",Science
"The bird at the center of the worst single-species mortality event in modern history isn’t recovering, scientists say",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/26/science/alaska-heat-wave-murres-global-warming/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. A marine heat wave has killed approximately half of Alaska’s common murre population, marking the largest recorded die-off of a single species in modern history,research has found. The catastrophic loss points to broader changes in marine environments driven bywarming ocean temperatures, which are rapidly and severely restructuring ecosystems and inhibiting the ability of such animals to thrive, according to a new study. The Northeast Pacific heat wave, known as “the Blob,” spanned the ocean ecosystem from California to the Gulf of Alaska in late 2014 to 2016. Related articleUS wildlife officials move to add iconic monarch butterfly to threatened species list The event is considered the largest and longest known marineheat wave, with temperatures rising by 2.5 to 3 degrees Celsius (4.5 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal levels, said Brie Drummond, coauthor of the study that published December 12 in the journalScience. Common murres, or Uria aalge,are known for their distinctive black-and-white feathers, resembling the tuxedoed look of penguins. These predators play a critical role in regulating energy flow within the marine food web in the Northern Hemisphere. While murres have experienced smaller die-offs in the past as a result of environmental and human-induced factors, they typically recover quickly when favorable conditions return. However, the magnitude and speed of the die-off during this heat wave was particularly alarming to Drummond and her team. The researchers determined the scale of this catastrophic population loss by tracking extreme population declines at 13 colonies across the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea that have been monitored long-term. By the end of the 2016 heat wave, Drummond and her team counted more than 62,000 common murre carcasses, which only accounted for a fraction of those lost since most dead seabirds never appear on land. From there, biologists monitored the rate at which common murres were dying and reproducing and found no signs of the colonies returning to their previous size. “The only reason we had this data and were able to detect this (event) was that we had these long-term data sets and long-term monitoring,” said Drummond, a wildlife biologist at the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. “(Monitoring) is the only way we’ll be able to continue to look at what happens in the future.” As temperatures in Alaska rose, the murres’ food supply dwindled, with one of their primary prey, Pacific cod, plunging by about 80% between 2013 and 2017, the study revealed. With the collapse of this key food source, about 4 million common murres died in Alaska within the period from 2014 to 2016, the researchers estimated. “There are about 8 million people in New York City, so it would be like losing half of the population … in a single winter,” Drummond said. Before the start of the 2014 heat wave, Alaska’s murre population made up 25% of the world’s population of the seabird species. However, when comparing the seven-year period before the heat wave (2008 to 2014) with the seven-year span following (2016 to 2022), the study found the murre population in 13 colonies spread between the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea declined anywhere from 52% to 78%. Drummond and her colleagues continued monitoring the murres from 2016 to 2022 after the end of the heat wave but found no signs of recovery. Related articleCalifornia squirrels are eating another rodent for the first time, new study finds While further research is necessary to fully understand why murres are not bouncing back, Drummond’s team believes the changes are driven by shifts in the marine ecosystem, especially those associated with food supply. Reproductive challenges and relocation difficulties also may be contributing to the species’ lack of rehabilitation, according to Dr. Falk Huettmann, an associate professor of wildlife ecology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who was not involved in the study. Unlike some other species, seabirds such as murres take a longer time to reproduce, making repopulation a slower process, Huettmann said. Additionally, Huettmann noted that murres are bound to the colonies they reside in, and as they are forced to relocate, it can be more difficult to adjust to new conditions. While temperatures continue to rise in areas such as Alaska, tropical or subtropical waters are moving into different areas, Huettmann said, which creates conditions for an entirely new ecosystem. With these environmental shifts, animals will either adapt or be unable to survive in the new climate. Murres are not the only species in Alaskan waters undergoing significant changes. Huettmann noted thetufted puffin, a sensitive marine bird, has been seen migrating north because of poor conditions in southern areas of the North Pacific, including California, Japan and Russia, yet it’s struggling to adapt to its new home. King salmon, whales and crabs are other species grappling with finding their place, he said. While heat waves have affected many species, other populations aren’t substantially impacted, Drummond said. Related articleWild dolphins off US Southeast coast found with microplastics in their breath, study says Half of the data collected from organisms such as phytoplankton and even homeothermic top predators presented “neutral” responses to the heat wave. Twenty percent of these apex predators even responded positively to the abnormal heat exposure, according to the study. Homeothermic animals, including birds and mammals, have stable internal body temperatures regardless of the environmental temperature. “That gives us perspective on which species might more readily adapt to these kinds of warming water events in the future and which will not,” Drummond said. Although rising temperatures are the primary factor affecting animals like murres, other elements also may be contributing to marine life changes. “From an ecological perspective …microplastics, ocean acidification, sea levels rising and chronic oil spills … are other massive mortality factors at play,” Huettmann said. However, studies tracking the long-term effects of climate events on marine life are limited, so scientists are still uncertain about how these animals will continue to be impacted in the future.",Science

Located in the Yamagata region about 260 miles north of Tokyo, the onsen is one of the most famous in Japan, drawing around 330,000 visitors each year. Travelers from around the world flock to the 300-year-old town during winter not only for a dip in the onsen but its picturesque scenery of traditional Edo-period buildings blanketed in snow – speculated to be the inspiration for Oscar-winning animatorHayao Miyazaki’s film Spirited Away. But its popularity has also caused problems for residents in the otherwise tranquil town, with reports of altercations over photo spots and parking places. “Many guests became angry (were shouting) over good spots for the purpose of taking pictures, leading to traffic rules being broken, cheating, and making people seek better places and easier ways than others,” the onsen said on its website, regretting that its “vague management” had caused issues. Starting January 7, those wanting to enter the onsen town after 5pm will be required to purchase a ticket, according to Ginzan Onsen Information Center. Visitors without bookings at local hotels will be banned after 8pm. Tickets, including the bus rides, cost 1150 yen, about $7.

Since then, Allie and David had met in person. They’d linked up on social media. And in gratitude for her priceless gift, David had added Allie to his United Airlines travel benefits so she “travels like my children or my family do,” the pilot told CNN. That’s how David, who’d just piloted a flight from Dallas to Houston, got the ping: Allie was also in Houston, about to board outbound Flight 2223. But it was due to take off in 40 minutes. And David was on the other side of the airport. He reached out to the jet’s captain. And dashed to the gate. David was just 44 when he went from incredibly healthy to being on a ventilator. When his cold symptoms turned into a fever, David rushed to an emergency room in August 2016. He explained to the doctor that “something was seriously wrong” because the left side of his body was in pain and a lymph node was swelling up in his neck. A CT scan and other tests revealed a grim diagnosis a few days later. Acute myeloid leukemia – a rare, fast-growing blood and bone marrow cancer originating from abnormal blood stem cells – tends to affectolder adults, according toYale Medicine. Only about29.5%of patients are expected to live for at least fiveyears after diagnosis. A doctor after one chemotherapy treatment told David he had a 5% chance of survival because his type of this cancer had a genetic mutation “that was really, really bad,” David recounted. “I couldn’t even walk five steps. I couldn’t move. I could barely just move my legs,” David said. “I couldn’t sit up, I couldn’t even get out of bed.” Being a usually active person, David decided to set small goals for himself, like exercising during commercialsor walking to the bathroom. He tried to stay positive, relying on faith and prayers for strength. His hopes dwindled when two more rounds of chemotherapy failed to fight the illness. But if he found the right match, David’s cancerous, Type B-positive blood could be replaced. It could return him to health. And give him more years with his wife and kids. Advancements in acute myeloid leukemia treatment have significantly improved remission rates, according to the National Cancer Institute. Nowadays, most transplants use stem cells from donor blood – rather than bone marrow – in a much less complicated process, according to theCleveland Clinic. But finding a donor match can be challenging: Only about 30% of patients have a relative who can donate; for the rest, doctors search national and international donor registries,according to theCleveland Clinic. Donors and patients arematchedbased on inherited genes called human leukocyte antigens, which carry the code for markers that the body uses to know which cells belong. Donors and recipients can have incompatible blood types, and it isn’t a factor in the match. Siblings are often the best matches because they have the same biological parents. But David’s brother wasn’t an ideal match. So, his doctors tried the registries. Allie got the call. Four years earlier, as an 18-year-old behavioral sciences undergrad, she had helped organize the Purdue University Dance Marathon to raise money for an Indiana children’s hospital. During the 16-hour event, she’d swabbed her cheek to join the National Marrow Donor Program, a global nonprofit facilitating bone marrow and stem cell transplants for patients with life-threatening blood cancers. Some 18,000 Americans are diagnosed each year with a life-threatening illness – including leukemia, lymphoma, sickle cell disease and more than 70 others – that could be treated with a marrow or blood cell transplant,accordingto the Health Resources and Services Administration. But some patients, the federal agencysays, will never find a match. When Allie learned her blood matched someone in need, she was excited. “I really wanted to be able to help someone in this type of way,” she told CNN, “and I think that’s also because of my interest in public health and my interest in medicine.” Still, she didn’t have a lot of details about the person she was donating to. In the US, stem cell recipients typically have to wait at least a year before they can meet their donors, according to the National Marrow Donor Program. Allie soon went to the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center in Houston, where for eight hours she donated peripheral blood stem cells through apheresis, a nonsurgical procedure that removes components from a donor’s blood and then returns what remains to their body, according to the National Cancer Institute. “You’re a little sore, you’re a little tired, but you get to go home that night, and it’s really, really rewarding,” she recalled. On December 21, 2016 – when the winter solstice blanketed Texas with more than 14 hours of darkness – doctors at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas injected Allie’s bone marrow stem cells into David’s arm, he said. “Stem cells are like seeds, and they went into my bone and planted, and they grew her blood,” he told CNN. The treatment was successful, David said, changing his Type B-positive blood to Type O-negative. Still, David didn’t know who’d given him this life-saving gift. Over the next 18 months, David got better and better, until he was strong enough to return to work as a United Airlines pilot. Allie, meanwhile, kept up her studies, focusing more and more on how to help people make healthy choices to prevent chronic diseases like cancer. The two eventually were introduced to each other by the donor program in March 2018. And in August 2018, David and Allie finally met in person for the first time at an event hosted by Baylor Medical Center. After an onstage Q&A session for patients and staff, Allie and her parents and David and his family went out to lunch. David still gets emotional about it. “It’s still overwhelming to me that a stranger would take the time to save my life,” he said. “It just gave me hope.” “My blood is identical to Allie’s now,” David said. The pair would catch up every year on the anniversary of David’s transplant, said Allie, who donated peripheral blood stem cells again in 2018 to a different recipient and has encouraged others to consider joining the bone marrow registry. Beyond that, as a small token of his thanks, David shared his travel benefits with Allie. “It’s the least that I could do,” he explained. “She saved my life.” Owing to account notifications, David from time to time surprises Allie at an airport where they both happen to be, he said. She’s now 30, with a Ph.D. and a job as a cancer prevention public health researcher at the University of California, Davis, emphasizing the importance of preventive health care, including regular doctor visits, stress management and a healthy lifestyle, she said. “We both like to keep things light, we both like to joke around,” he said, “and we both like to be silly with each other.” For her part, Allie often thinks of David when she flies – and then usually texts or calls him, she said. “Every time I see him, he’s got a smile on his face,” she said. “He’s in such a great mood.” As Allie waited last week for her flight to depart from Houston, it had been four years since she’d seen David in person. He knew she was there, of course – and was racing toward her gate. But Allie wasn’t in a joking mood. Allie’s mom recently had a heart attack, she said. Like David before his cancer diagnosis, “she had felt healthy, she didn’t see it coming on.” And given Allie’s profession, the illness hit close to home. Boarding began, and Allie found her seat on the plane. As she waited for the aircraft’s doors to close, she heard its PA system begin to crackle. She didn’t think much of it. Then, she heard his name. At first, it surprised her. Then, she thought: “Of course, he’s doing this.’” David had made it in time. And in an announcement to everyone aboard, he shared his transplant story. Then, he walked over to the passenger who’d made it all happen. It’s “not every day you can get to hug someone that can save your life,” he said. “Allie is the true hero of this story. I am just glad to be alive.” Other passengers erupted in applause. It would be another week before the winter solstice marking the eighth anniversary of David’s transplant. But their impromptu reunion became a “really fun” highlight to Allie’s long travel day, especially given her mom’s health crisis. While Allie’s mom is doing better now, the pair are reminded to never take good health for granted. “Every year around this time I am just so grateful,” David told CNN. “I can’t believe that much time has gone by,” Allie added. “I would still to this day absolutely do it again.”",Society
Undersea tunnels connect remote islands halfway between Iceland and Scotland,https://www.cnn.com/travel/faroe-islands-undersea-tunnels-roundabout/,"In the Faroe Islands, wild, unpredictable weather — fierce winds and rain, and thick fog that settles like a curtain — can sometimes make travel by car or ferry problematic. No wonder the Faroese love their tunnels. They’ve built 17 of them on land and four subsea — including the world’s only subsea tunnel with a roundabout that’s underwater. The network makes for easier navigation of the self-governing island nationwithin the Kingdom of Denmark. “Though we are 18 islands, we often joke that (because of the tunnels) we defy the fact that we are islands,” says Súsanna Sørensen, marketing manager of Visit Faroe Islands. Located in the North Atlantic halfway between Iceland and Scotland, the volcanic islands’ unspoiled scenery wows visitors. The two latest subsea tunnels are statement makers, too. “These are our Eiffel Tower or Big Ben,” says Teitur Samuelsen, CEO of Eystur-og Sandoyartunlar, the company operating the tunnels, “with people, especially tourists, driving through them just to see the art.” Art? Yes, indeed. A stunning marriage of art and engineering. Every day, more than 6,000 vehicles travel through the nearly seven-mile (11-kilometer) subsea tunnel connecting Streymoy, the largest of the Faroe Islands and home to Tórshavn (one of the world’s smallest capitals), with Eysturoy, the archipelago’s next biggest island. In addition to its stunning natural landscapes, Eysturoy is home to the G! Festival, an outstanding local and international musical event held each July in the waterfront village of Syðrugøta. Construction of the Eysturoy Tunnel took about four years, opening in December 2020. These subsea tunnels are created by using the drill and blast method: drilling holes in the basalt — a strong, igneous rock — and then packing the holes with dynamite. At its lowest point, the tunnel is about 614 feet (187 meters) below sea level. And though having the North Atlantic over your head might provoke anxiety, you can feel confident in its construction, saysSamuelsen. “The tunnels are designed by the world‘s leading engineers and geologists, so safety with regards to the Atlantic above is not an issue,” he says. Actually, the drive is kind of magical, with the highlight being a sculptural roundabout with shifting colors that is so striking, some compare it to the Aurora borealis or jellyfish glowing in the sunlight. Related articleWorld’s longest road and rail tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea “The roundabout — nicknamed ‘the jellyfish’ — is certainly a tourist attraction,” says Sørensen. Many take several turns around the roundabout to soak up the mesmerizing scene. Revered Faroese artist Tróndur Patursson was commissioned to create this vibrant installation. But why spend time and money putting art in subsea tunnels? “We have a lot of good art in the Faroes, and we’d like to support our artists. In addition, it breaks up the monotony in a long, dark tunnel, so it’s good for driving safety,” says Samuelsen. When this tunnel was created, a natural central basalt column was left standing for the roundabout where the tunnel branches off toward Strendur and Rókin, located on either side of a fjord on Eysturoy. The central column, radiating clouds of color, is ringed at its base by a striking steel sculpture. Drivers gaze at a steel ring of silhouettes, life-size people holding hands around the pillar and looking inward at the ever-changing lights. Patursson has said his intent was to represent how the Faroese, despite living in a rugged environment, are resilient, united in their accomplishments by working together. But for many, the circle of interlinked figures is evocative of the traditional Faroese chain dance that you’ll observe if you visit the Faroes for Ólavsøka, National Day, on July 29. Beyond the visuals, the tunnel is also saturated with auditory art. Musician Jens L. Thomsen composed the ethereal soundscape that you can listen to by tuning into FM97 when driving through. The experience was created by “recording the sounds of the construction as well as the silence in the tunnel,” says Thomsen. Instead of using conventional instruments, “this technique allowed me to find the voice of the tunnel,” adds Thomsen. The Eysturoy Tunnel isn’t the only dazzling undersea experience. Since December 2023, Streymoy and the wee island of Sandoy have been connected by the latest subsea tunnel, the Sandoy Tunnel. About 1,000 vehicles a day navigate the approximately six-and-a-half-mile stretch that at its nadir is 508 feet (155 meters) below the North Atlantic. You’ll find the visual and auditory art enthralling here as well. Along the rough basalt walls, almost a dozen glowing images reference some of the characters in Faroese folklore, such as a bishop wielding a battle ax, an old witch and a seal woman. This is the creation of Edward Fuglø, a prominent Faroese artist, who put a contemporary take on ancient cave paintings. He also depicts birds as an homage to the self-taught, 19th-century bird painter Díðrikur á Skarvanesi, the first known visual artist in the Faroes. Sunleif Rasmussen, a renowned Faroese composer, created the acoustic landscape. “I had a dream of the melody,” says Rasmussen.He relied on some of the sounds of the tunnel, including water dripping during the construction, as well as music by the lead singer of the pop group Snowflakes to produce this inventive electroacoustic work. This creates a surreal experience for those drivers tuning into FM100 while navigating this tunnel to Sandoy, where white, sandy beaches, tall sand dunes — the only ones in this archipelago — and an expansive lake that’s perfect for kayaking await. “With all the well-developed tunnel infrastructure, it’s easy for our guests to move around the country,” says Sørensen. With the roundabout tunnel, the driving time from the capital city Tórshavn to the island of Eysturoy was cut from about 60 minutes to about 15 minutes. It’s also easier to visit other islands. “You can now drive from Tórshavn to Klaksvik, the second largest city (located on Borðoy), in just 45 minutes versus 75 minutes,” adds Sørensen. The Sandoy Tunnel has been especially life-changing. “More and more people are now moving to Sandoy from Tórshavn. In one village where 145 people live, 10 apartments are under construction. This is a lot for us,” says resident Barbara av Skardi, who would never have considered moving to Sandoy if it wasn’t for the tunnel. “During winter, the ferry sometimes could be canceled for days” because of gusty winds and unpredictable currents, she says. New businesses are opening, and others are seeing an uptick in visitors. “Because of the tunnel, my wife, Barbara, and I both moved back to Sandoy and opened Cafe Retro,” says business co-owner Dávur Jacobsen. And according to Ólavur Jøkladal, director of the Sandur Art Museum, “The number of visitors has more than doubled since the tunnel opened.” These inventive undersea creations blend art and technology and mark a new era of connectedness for these remote islands.",World
What happened to ‘Australia’s Bigfoot’?,https://www.cnn.com/travel/australia-bigfoot-yowie-intl-hnk-dst/,"The small town of Kilcoy is not the site of the first, or even the most recent, “Yowie” sighting. And hunters of Australia’s version of Bigfoot are no more likely to see it there than anywhere else in the country’s vast, rugged bushland. Yet, for decades, a vacant-eyed replica of a towering, hairy beast has stared into the distance from a plinth in the center of town. It’s a monument to an astonishing encounter almost 45 years ago, one that Tony Solano says he’ll never forget. “To this day, I am still convinced. Take it to my grave,” said Solano, who hasn’t spoken in any detail about what happened for 20 years. Kilcoy is home to just 2,000 people, and there were even fewer on December 28, 1979, when Solano and a friend, then both 16, spotted something scary — and almost inexplicable — in the woods. They didn’t know what it was at the time, but the incident became folklore, and a drawcard for tourists to the small rural community, set in rolling hills about one hour north of Brisbane in the state of Queensland. Solano said he and a friend were “armed to the hilt” during a camping trip on private property near Sandy Creek, a narrow waterway that winds almost 45 kilometers (28 miles) through the region. “We had probably three or four guns, a .22, .22 Magnum, 20-gauge shotgun solids … We were out hopefully chasing some pigs, but it never eventuated,” said Solano, of a time well before Australia introduced some of the world’s toughest gun laws. Solano’s memories are hazier than they once were, but he says he will never forget the sounds of branches snapping, and the terror that surged through his body as his friend fired shots at a beast that loomed 2 to 3 meters (6.5 to 9.8 feet) tall in nearby bushes. The bullets missed, and the boys spent a wide-eyed night beside loaded guns before leaving their campsite to raise the alarm. After steadying their nerves, they returned a few days later with their biology teacher to make a plaster cast of its massive footprint and posed for a photo with it for the local paper, looking suitably afraid. The town went wild. Before long, Yowie branding was slapped on everything from spoons to T-shirts and, within a year, Kilcoy got its first Yowie statue, a sculpture carved from a single beech log hoisted onto a plinth in the center of town as a warning — or a lure — for curious onlookers. The wooden Yowie stood for decades in Yowie Park, becoming a target of trophy hunters who regularly lopped off its genitals as a souvenir. The original started rotting and was replaced by another wooden version, which suffered the same fate, so they gave up and made a replica of fiberglass that was gender neutral. But in March 2022 — despite being securely attached to the plinth — the whole thing disappeared. The specifics differ, but Yowies are generally described as much taller than a man, covered in hair and cloaked in an acrid stench with notes of wet dog and rotting flesh. Similar creatures are known as Bigfoot in the United States, Sasquatch in Canada, Hibagon in Japan, Yeren in China, and the Yeti or Abominable Snowman in the Himalayas. Some believe Yowies are capable of crossing dimensions, which is why their remains have never been found. Australia’s foremost Yowie hunter, Dean Harrison, is not so sure about that. “They look after their dead,” he said. Harrison runs Australian Yowie Research, a database that logs Yowie sightings across the country, and he’s struggling to work through a backlog. It’s not because there are more Yowies, he said, just more people who are less fearful of being ridiculed for sharing their story. Harrison’s first encounter with a Yowie was 30 years ago, when he was living in a home surrounded by trees on Tamborine Mountain in southeast Queensland. “I was walking towards the front door in the dark, and there was this awful noise coming from the swamp just beyond the fence,” he told CNN. “It was guttural, really guttural. I know koalas can make some pretty horrific noises, but this is nothing, nothing like a koala.” Harrison said he heard it walking on two feet, ripping foliage from the ground with every step. “And then it would throw whatever it’s pulling out, and you can hear it hit the other trees.” Did he see it as well? “No, this is all audio. But it was absolutely horrifying,” Harrison said. The next time was 1997, when one chased him through a field in the hinterland town of Ormeau. This time he saw it. “The way I describe it, is like a bear and a lion all in one. It was huge,” he said. An even closer encounter followed in 2009, when Harrison says he “got hit in the chest by one,” in wilderness around the tiny town of Kilkivan, north of Kilcoy. “You don’t get any closer than that,” he said. The next day, Harrison said he went for a solo hike and saw two Yowies. He didn’t have his phone on him, so wasn’t able to take a photo. However, years later Harrison and his team took thermal imaging equipment into the mountain ranges of D’Aguilar National Park, north of Brisbane, and caught on camera what they claimed were two Yowies. Blurry images show beasts standing at least 2.7 meters (9 feet) tall, he said. It’s hard to make out the Yowies’ features, but for a team of Yowie hunters who’ve dedicated years — even decades — to finding proof that they exist, the significance was extraordinary. Related articleThere’s probably no monster in Loch Ness. But we did find one of its best-kept secrets In Kilcoy, the Yowie statue’s theft made the local newspaper, and a longtime mayor of the surrounding Somerset region, Graeme Lehmann — who retired early this year — was quick to point the finger. “You’d nearly say it’d have to be out-of-towners,” Lehmann told CNN at the time. “I don’t think the locals would have tried to destroy some of their heritage. The Yowie’s been something that’s been an icon to Kilcoy for a long, long time.” John McAulay, a former stockbroker and retired cattle farmer, has lived in Kilcoy for most of his 83 years. Despite never having seen a Yowie, he has become the local Yowie expert, at one stage giving talks to busloads of tourists, though he receives fewer requests for that these days. He’s not convinced the creatures exist. But then again, maybe they do. “It’s just the number of these bloody stories you hear,” he told CNN. “They can’t all be nuts or on drugs.” At the time of the 1979 sighting, McAulay’s father Bill was chairman of the local council and part of the team that commissioned the Yowie statue. “He was very disbelieving of the whole thing,” McAulay said. “But he could see the opportunity – or the council could – for promoting the town, and they jumped right on it.” Bill McAulay planned Yowie boat rides, an illuminated Yowie Hall of Fame and Yowie safaris around the countryside, according to news reports from the early 1980s. None of that panned out but Yowies — or signs of them — aren’t hard to find in Kilcoy. Visitors can buy a Yowie loaf (double the standard size) at the local bakery opposite Yowie Park, where you can grab a Yowie coffee, near the training ground for the local Yowie football club. Until a couple of months ago, the local Exchange Hotel sold a Yowie burger. At the bar, regular Tony Morgan wasn’t buying the legend. “I think it’s a load of crap,” he said. “There’s no such thing.” Related articleDrop bears: The true history of a fake Australian animal The Yowie sighting may have made headlines in 1979, but the legend of the Kilcoy Yowie goes back much further than that — to Dreamtime stories of creation told by the land’s traditional custodians. More than a decade before the 1979 sighting, the late Aboriginal elder Uncle Willie Mackenzie, known to the Jinibara people as Gairabau, told the story of the Yowie toLindsey Winterbotham, a doctor with an interest in anthropology, who set about making audio recordings of Indigenous culture. Gairabau’s Yowie story goes a little like this: Yowie was a famed hunter who caught so much prey for the Jinibara people that they gifted him a black possum-skin cloak. But he became an outcast after stealing a beautiful Jinibara woman, who had been promised to another man. When Yowie refused demands to return her, the elders sang a song that condemned him to live forevermore as a large hairy creature wandering the Jinibara lands around what’s now known as Kilcoy. At night, when all is quiet, his cries can still be heard. Uncle Willie told the story to his grandniece Auntie Jacqui Kina, according to a sign that was erected a decade ago outside Kilcoy Hospital. It fell down, but a new sign featuring the story will soon be erected outside the hospital – another stop for tourists on the Yowie trail. McAulay may know everything there is to know about Yowies, but he has no idea who stole the statue. The Yowie turned up soon after it vanished, partially submerged in a lake, among lily pads and reeds, several meters behind the plinth in Yowie Park. A guide at the local information center speculated that the culprits may have been local teenagers, out partying late at night, potentially armed with a welder to cut through the bolts securing it in place. New Somerset Mayor Jason Wendt, who took the job in March, says police likely dealt with the thieves the old-fashioned way. “It’s probably country policing at its best,” he said. “They were probably caught and told off by the local police and then probably learned their lesson.” At the time of the theft, local police told CNN that the incident wasn’t caught on camera and there wasn’t enough evidence to investigate it. Wendt, a veterinarian by trade who’s lived in the area for 30 years, says every town in the Somerset region has its selling point, and for Kilcoy, it’s the Yowie. The region is spectacularly beautiful, particularly after rain when its hills become lush with fodder for grazing cattle. The relaxed vibe is sometimes interrupted at night by deep rumbling roars and occasional screeches. So, if not a Yowie, what is it? “Deer,” Wendt stated conclusively. But it could also be koalas, he added. “Have you ever heard koalas when they’re mating? They’re scary things.” It would be months before the Yowie statue was back on the plinth. The figure was repaired by a reluctant David Joffe, the director of sculpture company Natureworks, who has dedicated his life to creating realistic sculptures of oversized wildlife. Joffe told CNN the council first approached him in 2018 to replace the rotten wooden Yowie and again to fix the Yowie when it was dumped in the lake. He said he’d been excited about creating a more realistic Yowie for Kilcoy but was instead asked to make an exact copy of the original carving. “I normally don’t advertise the fact that we did it, because we didn’t, we just made a replica,” he said. “That there is a serious let-down, not a Yowie,” he said, referring to the statue. “If you look at the sculpture, all of the proportions are wrong.” The repaired Yowie still stares from the plinth in the center of town, out toward the service station on the main road where cattle trucks rattle back and forth from the local meat works. It’s been attached more securely to the plinth, to prevent any further late-night antics. Not far away, in the information center, the head of the original Yowie statue is kept in a glass case for visitors to admire. Plans are afoot to create an interactive display so visitors can immerse themselves in the legend. Solano says he is “amazed” the town is still talking about the incident, 45 years on. He says he didn’t see the creature, he just heard it, and that his friend, Warren Christensen, spied the beast and took the shot. Christensen told CNN he wants to leave the incident in the past. The former school friends are no longer in touch, Solano said. Solano is convinced the sighting was real, based on what the boys found when they returned: several large footprints, traces of brown hair on foliage, and headless hares whose bodies appeared to have been crushed. “You can make what you want out of it, but I’m a firm believer,” he said. “You can’t explain the footprints we’d seen, some of the hares around.” He also dismissed theories that it could have been another large animal. “Other people sort of judged it off by saying it was a large kangaroo. But you don’t get big reds, not around Kilcoy anyway, you have grays, but not big reds,” he said, referring to the largest breed of kangaroo that can stand 2 meters tall. “And other people said, ‘oh, you know, it was a big cow,’” he said. “No, not really. Cows don’t leave those sorts of footprints.” Solano no longer has the plaster cast they took of the Yowie’s footprint — it went missing during several house moves over the decades. He occasionally drives through Kilcoy but rarely stops — if he did he’d see his 16-year-old face in a yellowing newspaper article hanging on the wall of the local “hall of history.” Solano says he gained nothing from the sighting and has played no role in promoting it. He hasn’t needed to. The story has taken on a life of its own, and many Kilcoy residents are more than happy to share it. “Initially it was a bit of a story and now the town’s embraced it,” said Wendt, the Somerset mayor. “Is this creature really real?” he asked. “It’s talked about everywhere.”",World
Huge Asian city opens its first metro line,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/travel/ho-chi-minh-city-metro-open-intl-hnk/,"A dozen years after it broke ground, Vietnam’s largest city has unveiled its first mass rapid transit line. Hundreds of people lined up for the chance to be among the first passengers to board Metro Line 1 as it began operations in Ho Chi Minh City on Sunday, according to state-run news agency Viet Nam News. The line stretches from busy Ben Thanh market in the city center to the Soui Tien Theme Park outside itsnorthwestern boundary, with 14 stops – three underground and 11 above. Its opening comes after years of delays, caused by factors including the Covid-19 pandemic and financial constraints, according to state media. “After 17 years of planning and 12 years of construction, the inauguration of this metro line today marks a significant milestone in the advancement of public transportation within the city,” said city official Bui Xuan Cuong at a ceremony to inaugurate the line. The Vietnamese government has said it hopes the metro system will help reduce traffic in the notoriously congested city, which ishome to about 9 million people. Eight lines are planned, but the government has not announced opening dates for the others. As an incentive for travelers, tickets are free for the first month and there will be free connections to new electric buses that connect with the metro stops. After that, tickets will cost 7,000 to 20,000 dong (27 to 79 cents) depending on distance, while elderly and disabled riders will travel for free. Students and travelers using e-payment apps will receive discounts. Trains will run daily between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. Vietnam’s transit infrastructure has been the site of competition between Japan and China, both of whom are eager to strengthen their influence throughout Asia. Although Japan got into the game first, ultimately putting 43.7 trillion Vietnamese dong ($1.72 billion) into the Ho Chi Minh City project, capital city Hanoi’s China-backed system beat it to the punch by opening its first metro line in 2021. Construction on Hanoi’s second metro line is due to begin in 2025. Earlier this year, the Vietnamese government announced ambitious plans to build twohigh-speed rail linesconnecting with China, the country’s biggest trading partner. There are also plans to connect Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City by high-speed trains.",World
A searing portrait of the remote place astronauts fall to Earth,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/style/kazakhstan-andrew-mcconnell-soyuz/,"Space travel’s documentarians have long been preoccupied by departures — launchpads engulfed in billowing smoke and flames shooting from ascendant rocket boosters. But after seeing footage of a Russian Soyuz spacecraft crash down on the remote Kazakh Steppe 10 years ago, photographer Andrew McConnell became more enraptured by astronauts’ unceremonious return to Earth. “Every three months, this capsule would land in the middle of nowhere, and no one was really going to see it,” he recalled of the astronauts, of various nationalities, returning from the International Space Station (ISS). “It was sort of an obscure event, but such an extraordinary one,” added McConnell in a video call from Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. McConnell, who often works in conflict zones (and had just returned from assignment in Gaza), said he felt compelled to document a “positive human enterprise” rather than “just misery and suffering.” So, in 2015, he embarked on the first of over a dozen trips to Kazakhstan, where manned Soyuz craft — or rather their conical three-person landing capsules, no larger than a car — return to Earth with their human cargo. NASA had decommissioned its Space Shuttle program four years earlier, meaning the former Soviet republic was, at the time, the only gateway to the ISS. With the help of local photographers, McConnell contacted the crew that intercepts the capsules after their three-and-a-half-hour journey to Earth. He camped out with them on the grasslands northeast of the Russian-owned Baikonur Cosmodrome (where Soyuz missions depart from), waiting for what he called the “big explosion in the sky” that marked the spacecraft’s reentry. The ground team would then assess the wind’s impact on the capsule’s trajectory before racing across the steppe in Jeeps to meet it. Related articlePrada and Axiom Space unveil spacesuit designs for NASA’s Artemis III moon mission Initially, McConnell hoped to capture portraits of the astronauts immediately after landing. (“What would these people’s faces show after such a momentous event?” he had wondered.) But the reality of their return was not as profound as one might imagine: “They put hats on them, and give them a bunch of flowers, maybe a phone, and they’re like, ‘Hey, Mom, yeah, I’m back,”” he said. On that first trip in 2015, however, the Irish photographer encountered a different phenomenon — one he had not anticipated: The arrival of villagers from one of the few settlements in the sparsely populated region. “This little white car appeared on the horizon, and it drove up to us, weaving through these massive Russian Air Force helicopters that were sitting on the steppe,” McConnell recalled. “They were locals who’d come to see this extraordinary thing happening in their backyard. I was just fascinated by this; it hadn’t occurred to me that people actually live here.” So, while some of McConnell’s images feature renowned astronauts like Tim Peake and Kate Rubins, hisnew photo bookis more about the Kazakh communities whose lives have become inadvertently intertwined with space travel. Portraits of nomads on horseback appear alongside everyday scenes around Kenjebai-Samai, the village in which the photographer stayed before venturing onto the grasslands. The image of a young girl climbing on a makeshift fence made from space debris speaks to the curious indifference McConnell encountered among locals. “They were, surprisingly, unfamiliar with the landings. Some people in the village said they’d seen it once, and had gone out look at it,” he said, adding: “(The kids) are curious what these objects are, and they have a basic understanding that this thing happens somewhere ‘over there.’ But no one’s bringing them over to see it. (The landings happen) 30 kilometers away, but it may as well be 300 miles away.” Yet, the photographer saw strange parallels between these coexisting worlds: “You have the modern-day nomad — the astronaut — and the original nomads. And that’s sort of the heart of the whole book: a contrast between the two… It’s extraordinary the different lives we lead on this planet, and that these two worlds collide here.” The book’s other protagonist is the steppe itself. McConnell’s photos of this “portal to space,” as he described it, depict a vast, empty landscape littered with the detritus of space travel and scarred with open-pit coal mines. Related articleRare photos show the early years of NASA’s space shuttle era At times, the otherworldly scenes evoke a remote alien planet — an ambiguity the photographer exploits to powerful effect. His striking image of a ground crewmember approaching a Soyuz capsule, a wall of dust cloud before him, could easily be a faraway world in a science fiction movie. The book’s title, “Some Worlds Have Two Suns,” and the absence of accompanying captions, further suspends readers’ disbelief about where the images might be set. “I was struck by how, sometimes, you didn’t know what planet you were on,” McConnell said. “You think, ‘well, this might be Earth, but could this be another world?’” Kazakhstan’s role in Russia’s space program dates to the 1950s, when it was still part of the USSR. Located beside the Ural Mountains, a traditional dividing line between Europe and Asia, the arid steppe was further south — and thus closer to the equator — than most of Russia, shortening the journey to the thermosphere the ISS inhabits. The Baikonur Cosmodrome played a central role in both space travel and the Cold War. Humankind’s first ever artificial satellite, Sputnik, was launched there in 1957. So, too, were Laika the dog and Yuri Gagarin, who became the first human in space in 1961. The Soyuz (“union” in Russian) program began five years later and has since completedmore than 1,600 missions. After the Iron Curtain fell and Kazakhstan gained independence in 1991, Russia continued to lease the land on which the cosmodrome stands. And while McConnell was largely focused on the steppe, he visited the facility several times, capturing everything from gargantuan launchpads to intimate shots of astronauts undergoing spacesuit checks ahead of launch. In a sense, these photos document the end of an era for Kazakhstan’s (and, in McConnell’s view, Russia’s) role in spacefaring. The Russian space agency Roscosmos now operates a similar facility on its own soil, in Siberia, rendering the Baikonur Cosmodrome increasingly obsolete. Moreover, Soyuz craft are no longer the only way to transport crew to and from the ISS: In 2020, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon began shuttling passengers to the space station from US soil, while Boeing launched amanned Starliner test missionearlier this year. “Investment isn’t there anymore,” McConnell said of Russia’s space program. “Their innovation isn’t there. If you look at what SpaceX is doing now, it’s just extraordinary. And so, this place where it all began, I think, will fade — and that’s part of the story too.” “Some Worlds Have Two Suns,” published by GOST, is available now.","World, Science"
Divisive royal portraits and a $6.2-million banana: 2024’s biggest art controversies,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/25/style/biggest-art-controversies-2024/,"Big money, big ideas and big egos — the art world has all the necessary ingredients for a juicy controversy. This may be why eye-rolling and schadenfreude emerge so virulently whenever said controversies occur. After all, as the American painter Ad Reinhardt once quipped: “Art is too serious to be taken seriously.” The year in art included plenty of snark over new depictions of the British royal family that were perceived as too aggressive or too generic, as well as an infamous banana that returned to auction with a shocking hammer price. Works were accidentally thrown out, smashed or intentionally forged; and legal dramas unfolded thanks to badly behaved dealers and museum-targeting protestors. Here are 13 of the controversies that entertained, shook and shaped the art world in 2024: For some, the line between modern art and trash is vanishingly thin. Among them was the elevator technician at a Dutch museum whomistakenly threw awaypart of an artwork that had been made to resemble two empty beer cans. According to LAM Museum, in the Netherlands, the hand-painted work (titled “All the good times we spent together”) symbolized French artist Alexandre Lavet’s “cherished memories shared with dear friends.” The museum also said, in a statement, that it bore “no ill will” towards the technician — after all, the replica cans had intentionally been displayed in a glass elevator shaft as though they’d been left behind by construction workers. The items were later recovered intact from a trash bag before being cleaned and returned to display. The vandalization of cultural heritage in the name of protest, by Just Stop Oil and other activist groups, continued apace. TheMagna Carta, the“Mona Lisa”and Stonehenge were among the targets in 2024. But this was also a year of differing fortunes for the assailants. In the Netherlands, three Belgian climate activists who targeted Johannes Vermeer’s “Girl with a Pearl Earring” escaped unpunished, after an appeals courtoverturnedtheir two-month prison sentences. (They spent 23 days in detention). In September, however, a British judge handed the two young demonstrators who attacked Vincent van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” with tomato soup long custodial sentences of two years, and 20 months, respectively. Whether this will serve as a deterrent remains to be seen. Some museums aren’t taking any chances: London’s National Gallery, the target of several attacks in recent years, was among the institutions to step up their security by restricting liquids and large bags. Anyone outraged that a banana duct-taped to a wall sold for $120,000 in 2019 was in for a shock this year. In November, an edition of Maurizio Cattelan’s controversial artwork “Comedian” — which made headlines around the world when it firstsold for six figures— reemerged at auction with an estimate of $1 million to $1.5 million. The valuation proved to be conservative: After a bidding battle, Chinese billionaire Justin Sun paid $6.2 million for the viral work. For his money, the cryptocurrency entrepreneur received a roll of duct tape and one banana (not the original), as well as a certificate of authenticity and installation instructions. Sun also enjoyed a brief moment in the spotlight after he called a press conference in Hong Kong and promptly ate the banana for the cameras. “I want to eat it to become part of the (artwork’s) history,” he told CNN. In January, a Japanese authoradmittedthat her award-winning book, “The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy,” had been written with the help of ChatGPT. Shortly after receiving the Akutagawa Prize, Rie Kudan revealed that around 5% of the work was generated, word-for-word, by AI. “I plan to continue to profit from the use of AI in the writing of my novels, while letting my creativity express itself to the fullest,” the author told a press conference. Kudan’s admission stoked ongoing existential questions about the threat AI poses to the creative industries. But in June, photographer Miles Astray got revenge for team human by sneaking hisvery real photoof a flamingo into the AI category of the 1839 Awards’ Color Photography Contest — and winning the competition’s People’s Vote award. He wrote in an Instagram post thathe’d wanted to “prove that human-made content has not lost its relevance” and that “Mother Nature and her human interpreters can still beat the machine.” There was plenty of sympathy for the 4-year-old boy whoaccidentally smasheda Bronze Age jar at an Israeli archeological museum — not least because the artifact, which experts say was at least 3,500 years old, had been put on display without a glass case. The Hecht Museum in Haifa defended its decision to present the object without protective glass, saying that its founder emphasized the importance of making history accessible to the public. The museum alsowelcomed the boyand his parents back for a special tour. Curators at Palazzo Fava in Italy, however, were somewhat less understanding toward the man who shattered a porcelain sculpture by dissident artist Ai Weiwei. CCTV footage showed him aggressively pushing the sculpture over and then holding a piece of it above his head. The Chinese artist, who heard the smashing noise from an adjacent room, described the man’s actions as “unacceptable,” tellingthe Art Newspaper: “Such acts not only undermine the museum’s role as a public space but also pose potential physical threats, beyond merely damaging the meaning an artwork carries.” A small town in Wales welcomed an unexpected visitor in June: a large, pink, inflatable man on all fours. But the 43-foot-tall sculpture — a laughing self-portrait of the Chinese contemporary artist Yue Minjun — divided opinion in Ruthin, where it was displayed on the front lawn of a local school. The school’s principal Frances King told CNN that Yue’s work has a “deep philosophical understanding” but admitted there had been “mixed responses.” Locals spoken to by CNN meanwhile described the inflatable man as everything from “absolutely wonderful” to “a bit odd.” Perhaps most importantly, though, the students “love it” King said, adding that the children were “really quite fond” of the installation. The British royal family has continued to overhaul its public image in the wake of Queen Elizabeth II’s death. But her son King Charles III’s firstofficial portraitsince his coronation might not have been what they had in mind. On social media, the aggressively red 8.5- by 6.5-foot painting was variously described as the “visual representation of the massacre cause by colonizers” and looking “like he’s going straight to hell.” Others were more sympathetic, with art historian Richard Morris saying the “really liked” British artist Jonathan Yeo’s portrait,writingon X that before photography, to have a great painter “capture your real appearance you accepted the revelation of your flaws and your mortality.” A more reservedportrait of Catherine, Princess of Wales that appeared on thecoverof Tatler proved similarly divisive. Alastair Sooke, chief art critic at British newspaper The Daily Telegraph,wrotethat the painting by artist Hannah Uzor was “intolerably bad” and “shows no flicker of resemblance to its subject.” And in Northern Ireland, a new sculpture ﻿by Anto Brennan paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip (and two of their corgis) alsoraised eyebrows. In October, Manhattan-based art advisor Lisa Schiffpled guilty to wire fraudand agreed to forfeit the $6.5 million she was accused of making through the sale of (or, in some cases, the failure to buy) 55 artworks. According to the US Department of Justice, Schiff defrauded at least 12 clients — including art collectors, an artist, the estate of another artist and a gallery — by not disclosing that their art had sold, or by not purchasing works they had paid for. She used the funds for business and personal expenses, in what authorities called “half a decade of deceit.” Schiff will be sentenced in January. This year also marked the release of disgraced art dealer Inigo Philbrick, four years into his seven-year prison sentence — also for wire fraud. Philbrick’s$86-million scheme, the largest art fraud in American history, saw him fake documents, conceal ownership interests and invent a fictional art collector as he collateralized and resold shares in blue-chip contemporary art. A women-only art space exploring themes of misogyny was at center of two controversies this year: adiscrimination ruling, after a disgruntled man was denied entry, and the discovery that three of the exhibit’s “Picassos”had been forgedby the museum’s curator. The Ladies Lounge at the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Tasmania, Australia had been open for four years when, following a visitor complaint, a local tribunal ordered it to stop refusing entry to “persons who do not identify as ladies.” The artist and curator behind the installation, Kirsha Kaechele, opted to close the space rather than allow men in, instead moving three of the exhibit’s Picasso artworks toa women’s restroom. The plot thickened when Kaechele admitted that she had forged the three works herself because she wanted them to match the original space’s color scheme and green silk curtains. Then, in September, the Supreme Court of Tasmania overturned the discrimination ruling and the Ladies Loungereopenedin December — though, this time, a limited number of tickets were made available to men (via ballot and only on certain days) for “domestic arts lessons and other reparations,” the museum said. A German museum worker was fired afterhanging his own arton the gallery’s walls. The 51-year-old exhibition technician, a self-proclaimed “freelance artist,” smuggled one of his paintings into Munich’s Pinakothek der Moderne out of hours, according to German tabloid Süddeutsche Zeitung and German police. It is not known how long the painting hung on the wall before security realized, but a museum spokesperson said it was likely not there for long. The man later emailed his employer confessing his actions and was promptly fired, reported to the police and banned from the museum. Chinese artist duo the Gao Brothers were known for, among other things, provocative sculptures of Mao Zedong — in a country notoriously sensitive about its former ruler’s legacy. But that was well over a decade ago, during a relatively liberal era for artistic expression. In September, 68-year-old Gao Zhen was detained by Chinese authorities, according to his brother and artistic partner, Gao Qiang. The US-based artist told CNN that police raided his brother’s art studio on the outskirts of Beijing on suspicion of slandering China’s “heroes and martyrs,” an offense punishable by up to three years in prison. The public security bureau that Gao Qiang accused of detaining his brother, in Hebei province’s Sanhe city, declined to comment to CNN at the time. Gao Zhen remains in detention, according to regular updates made to the duo’sFacebook page. The London play “The Years” was temporarily paused after audience members reported feeling unwell during a graphic scene depicting an abortion. Staff at the Almeida Theatre were forced tobriefly stopin late July, with multiple audience members requiring assistance. The theater’s website had carried a content warning for the play, which ran for one hour and 55 minutes without an interval. Directed by Eline Arbo, it is based on “Les Années,” the autobiography of Nobel Prize-winning French writer Annie Ernaux. A spokeswoman for the Almeida confirmed the episode in an email to CNN at the time, but said that “all audience members were quick to recover after brief assistance.” Despite the ongoing drip of Nazi-looted artworks being returned to their rightful owners (or their descendants), 2024 was a frustrating year for many of the affected families. In March, the World Jewish Restitution Organization published a report saying over half the countries that signed the Washington Conference Principles — rules guiding the restitution of art confiscated by the Nazis in Germany before or during World War II — had made “little or no progress.” Among the most controversial cases was that of Camille Pissarro’s “Rue Saint Honore, apres midi, effet de pluie”. In 1939, the member of a prominent Jewish family was forced to sell the painting to obtain a visa and flee Germany, and many decades later it ended up in the Thyssen-Bornemisza museum in Madrid. In January, almost two years after the US Supreme Courtruled in favorof the woman’s family, an appeals court judgesaidthat although Spain should have voluntarily relinquished the painting, it was not legally required to do so, according to Reuters. There were, however, a handful of victories. In October, Claude Monet’s long-lost “Bord de Mer” was returned to the descendants of its original owners after the pastel work was listed for sale by Louisiana art dealer, prompting an FBI investigation. CNN’s Jack Guy, Jacqui Palumbo, Nectar Gan, Stephy Chung, Christy Choi, Kathleen Magramo, Lianne Kolirin, Billy Stockwell, Francesca Annio, Manveena Suri, Hannah Rabinowitz, Emily Blumenthal, Tierney Sneed, Chris Stern, Louis Mian and Catherine Nicholls contributed reporting to these stories.",World
Costume designer of ‘A Complete Unknown’ transformed Timothée Chalamet,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/24/style/bob-dylan-arianne-phillips-complete-unknown-costumes/,"If fashion is a language, Arianne Phillips, costume designer on James Mangold’s latest film “A Complete Unknown,” is a polyglot. In 2005, she mastered the visual lexicon of Johnny Cash’s style for Mangold’s “Walk the Line,” dressing the Rockabilly legend in Western work shirts and all-black stagewear. For 2019’s “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood,” Phillips perused Sharon Tate’s real wardrobe to outfit Margot Robbie in the same snakeskin trench coat and yellow hot pants that the actor and model wore before her harrowing death in 1969. But for the last five years, Phillips has been studying Bob Dylan — becoming “fluent” in both his worldview and his wardrobe. Releasing on Christmas Day in the US, “A Complete Unknown” stars Timothée Chalamet as Dylan, charting the musician’s meteoric rise from his arrival in New York at age 19 to becoming a bonafide star at 24. “We were recreating known events that are widely documented,” Phillips told CNN in a video interview. “That was the beginning point for me, just in terms of the research. Excavating and forensically breaking the script down to known events.” The film spans the years 1961 to 1965 and covers seminal moments in the folk-rock star’s early career, including, the now-iconic 1963 photoshoot of his “Freewheelin’” album cover, his tumultuous 1964 year tour with Joan Baez and his divisive performance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Costumes tied to these occasions were simpler to execute because Phillips faithfully recreated them. Take the leather jacket and red button-down Dylan wore performing at Newport, during which he was booed relentlessly by the crowd for playing an electric guitar, or his green and white polka-dot blouse from the same weekend. But Chalamet has more than 65 costume changes, in the film’s depiction of behind-the-scenes moments, Phillips explains, when Dylan was either not yet famous, or off-duty at home. “You know (his) stage persona, you know the news reels,” Phillips said. “But what we don’t see are many photos of him in his private time, when he’s not on stage or promoting something.” Related articleHow ‘The Brutalist’ built architect László Tóth — inside and out In order to fill in the gaps, she had to embody Dylan, picturing which pair of jeans he would pick to walk around Manhattan, the shirt he’d wear to go to the studio, or which jacket he’d grab for a drive on his Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle. “We didn’t have access to personal photographs. So my way in is really becoming fluent in Bob, in the research… understanding his aesthetic, how he dressed himself and also learning through the people that knew him,” she explained. According to Phillips, Dylan gave Mangold notes on the film’s script, but that was the full extent of the rock star’s involvement. No access was granted to his personal wardrobe, either, so Phillips relied on various biographies and books about his life. The 2008 memoir “A Freewheelin’ Time,” written by Dylan’s former girlfriend Suze Rotolo, was also particularly helpful in capturing the essence of those early years. “I learned a lot from her,” Phillips said of Rotolo, who died in 2011, and is played by Elle Fanning in the film as the character Sylvie Russo. “How Bob dressed himself and (how he) wanted to present to the world — his persona. I think that it’s a story of a young person finding their way in the world, (figuring out) how they want people to perceive them, (experiencing) freedom and moving away from home. I think we can all relate to that, when we’re 19 or 20, finding our own personal style.” After receiving the call to join the film in 2019, Phillips spent years reading around her new subject and building a robust visual archive of images. Slowly, a Bob Dylan fashion formula emerged. “My throughline was really the denim he wore,” she said. Phillips partnered up with Paul O’Neill, head of vintage collections at the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco, to track down and verify Dylan’s preferred pair of jeans. Early in the decade, it’s the classic 501s. “You can see him wearing the 1963 version of 501s on the cover of “Freewheelin’,” she said.  “They were able to help me source a lot of vintage Levi’s for the movie.” But it wasn’t long before his sartorial tastes switched. In 1965, after spending some time with the Beatles in the UK, Dylan was influenced by the slick mod look often found on London’s Carnaby Street. He switched up his looser fit denim for something skinnier. “They were called Super Slims and they’re collectible and super hard to find,” Phillips said of the style of jeans. “So lucky for us, (Levi’s) recreated them and made them bespoke for us, which was thrilling.” Earlier this month, Levi’sannouncedthey were reissuing Dylan’s favorite 1955 501 jean, as well as his classic suede Trucker jacket, for a limited time. Dylan’s experimental style and playful approach to clothes meant a lot of costume changes for Chalamet. “We had a very ambitious shooting schedule,” Phillips said. “Certain days we were doing ‘61 and ‘62 looks, to the ‘65 looks and back to ‘63. It was mad. Really really busy. So being able to be the support for the actors in terms of helping them align where we were in time when shooting these scenes is a part of my job that I love… Costumes really serve a tactile experience for an actor and help them access that character.” Related articleSweat-soaked nightgowns and corsets: ‘Nosferatu’s not-so-subtle art of sartorial seduction Chalamet has tackled historical dramas and memoir adaptations before, but “A Complete Unknown” marks the actor’s first foray into celebrity biopic territory. Although he was stretched tight between music rehearsals, vocal coaching and pre-recording performances, Phillips nods to Chalamet’s patience with their many fittings. “It’s a very intimate job, costume design,” she said. “We’re the only department on the (set) that’s like, ‘Hi, nice to meet you. Take your clothes off.’ There’s a lot of trust involved.” Since the press tour began, the cast and crew of “A Complete Unknown” have been blessed with an acknowledgement from Dylan himself. “There’s a movie about me opening soon,” 83-year-old Dylan tweeted, adding that Chalamet was starring as him (which the actor promptly shared to his own 19.3 million Instagram followers). “Timmy’s a brilliant actor so I’m sure he’s going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me.” “It’s a different experience to work on a film about a living person,” Phillips said. “I hope that he (Dylan) sees the film and I hope he enjoys it.” Yet she doesn’t lament the fact that her team didn’t have access to the star’s wardrobe; as she noted: “We’re not making a documentary.” “And filming is quite hardcore,” Phillips added. “I wouldn’t expect Bob Dylan to have any (clothing) that lasted 60 years, and if he did that should be in a museum, not in a movie.”",Entertainment
Tight hip flexors? This simple move restores mobility in minutes,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/27/health/tight-hip-flexors-stretch-wellness/,"Editor’s note:Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.” If you have ever felt tension in the front of your hips after sitting too long, struggled with lowerback painor had difficulty touching your toes, your hip flexors may be to blame. These often overlooked muscles play a vital role in posture, climbing stairs,running and more, yet modern sedentary lifestyles and repetitive motion can leave them short and tight. The good news? You can lengthen and relieve tight hip flexors in minutes with a simple stretch that targets the tension from all angles. The three-way hip flexor release is a mobility exercise I practiced and refined over years of working with professional athletes to address the varying tension patterns caused by different sports movements. Recognizing the need for a multidirectional approach, I designed this method to target and release all the key muscles involved in hip flexion, unlike traditional stretches that focus on a single angle at the front of the hip. Related articleYour 10-step guide to moving better Yourhip flexors are a group of musclesprimarily responsible for lifting your knees and bending at the waist. These include: •Iliopsoas:The powerhouse of hip flexion, a combination of two muscles — the iliacus and psoas — which, together, connect yourpelvis, lumbar spine (low back) and femur (upper leg bone). •Rectus femoris:A quadriceps (thigh) muscle that crosses both the hip and knee and serves as a primary hip flexor. •Sartorius:As the longest muscle in the body, it runs from the hip to the shin and assists with hip flexion and external rotation. •Tensor fasciae latae:Located on the outside of your upper thigh, it works with the rectus femoris to flex the hip and contributes to hip abduction and internal rotation. When any of these muscles are tight, the tension pulls your pelvis forward into an anterior tilt, putting compressive stress on your lumbar spine and knees that can lead to hip immobility, low back strain, knee problems and more. Because these muscles connect your upper body to your lower body, tight hip flexors not only cause discomfort, immobility and increased injury risk, but they can also lead to changes in posture, gait and balance. Hip flexor tension is caused by both overuse and underuse. Repetitive movements from sports and activities such as running, biking and stair climbing can shorten and tighten your hip flexors, while excessive sitting leads to the same result — but with added weakness. Related articleMove better and sidestep injury with the side lunge Tight hip flexors are a surprising but common cause of chronic tension in your hamstrings — the muscles on the backs of your legs that stretch when you bend to touch your toes. Since hamstrings attach from your knees to your pelvis, tight hip flexors pulling the pelvis forward into an anterior tilt also pull the hamstrings into a lengthened, tightened state. Although it might feel as if you should try to stretch your hamstrings for relief,attempting to stretchalready lengthened hamstrings won’t relieve the tension and can even cause harm in the form of strains and tears. When tight hip flexors accompany tight hamstrings, releasing your hip flexors to restore a neutral pelvis is the only way to release your hamstrings as well. This exercise is effective because repositioning the hip joint stretches the hip flexors from three different angles, ensuring all the muscles involved are engaged and released. Adding a side bend to each position enhances the stretch by involving related core and back muscles, including the obliques, quadratus lumborum and latissimus dorsi. The result? A complete release that improves mobility in the hips, core, legs and lower back. Practicing this exercise for a few minutes a day, several times a week, helps counteract the effects of overuse or underuse, allowing you to move and feel better — whether you’re recovering from a workout or trying to combat the stiffness caused by too much sitting. Follow the directions for each of the three positions consecutively and then repeat the sequence on the other side. Begin in a kneeling lunge with your left leg forward and your right knee aligned under your hip, resting on a pad or folded towel to cushion it. If balance is a challenge, position yourself next to a chair or other support on your left side. Curl your right toes forward behind you. Keep your torso upright and your hands on your hips. Exhale as you bring your ribs down and tuck your pelvis under in a posterior tilt, flattening your low back and curling your tailbone down until you feel a stretch at the front of your right hip. Continue to hold this position as you raise your right arm overhead, exhaling as you side bend to the left to deepen the stretch. Take three slow, deep breaths, focusing on bringing your left ribs in and down on each exhale to increase the side bend. Shift your left leg out to the left about 4 to 6 inches to widen your stance. Keep your left toes pointed forward and knee in line with your ankle. Externally rotate your right hip (turn your thigh outward), spinning clockwise on your knee to reposition your right foot to the left side of your body behind you as far as it will go naturally — without force or stress on your knee. Exhale and bring your ribs down while tucking your pelvis under, like you did in the first position, and then add the side bend to the left. Hold for three breaths. From the same wide stance, internally rotate your right hip (turn your thigh inward), spinning counterclockwise on your knee to move your right foot out to the right side of your body. Repeat the same steps as the previous positions and add the side bend to the left. Hold for three breaths. Note:You should feel a stretch in your hip flexor, thigh, side waist and back muscles — but never pain. When adjusting your foot and leg for positions 2 and 3, the movement should come from your hip, not your knee. If you feel pain, back off and reposition. If you cannot achieve a pain-free position, stop and consult a doctor or physical therapist.

By taking a few minutes to address the tension at its source, you can improve your mobility, ease discomfort and keep your hips strong. Whether you are desk-bound or a pro athlete, this quick and effective exercise is a game changer for anyone wanting to move and feel better.

"Certain foods may disrupt your body’s fight against cancer cells, study says",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/health/colon-cancer-omega-6-ultraprocessed-food-wellness/,"Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life. The food you eat may be affecting your body’s ability to fight cancer cells in the colon, according to a new study. The potential culprit: an overabundance of certain omega-6 fatty acids — perhaps fromultraprocessed foodsin your diet — that may hinder the anti-inflammatory and tumor-fighting properties of another essential fatty acid, omega-3. Related articleFish oil supplements may raise risk of stroke, heart issues, study suggests “There are mutations every day in the GI (gastrointestinal) tract, and normally they’re quashed right away by the immune system with the help of molecules or mediators from omega-3s,” said Dr. Timothy Yeatman, senior coauthor of the studypublished Tuesdayin Gut,the journal of the British Society of Gastroenterology. “But if you have a body subjected to years of a chronic inflammatory milieu created by an imbalance of omega-6s, the type commonly found in ultraprocessed and junk foods, I believe it’s easier for a mutation to take hold and harder for the body to fight it,” said Yeatman, a surgical oncologist and professor at the University of South Florida and the Tampa  General Hospital Cancer Institute. A Western diet is often high in omega-6 fatty acids, experts say, due to widely available seed oils often used to fry fast foods and manufacture the ultraprocessed foods that now make up about70% of the US food supply.Linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid that is found in corn, peanut, soybean, safflower and sunflower oils, is themost common omega-6in the US food supply. Many people have a significant imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 in their bodies — aNovember 2015 studyfound levels of linoleic acid have increased by 136% in the fat tissue of Americans over the past half century. “It’s a leap to say that omega-6s from ultraprocessed foods are the cause. Americans have few omega-3s because they dislike fatty fish such as mackerel, herring and sardines, which are great sources,” said Dr. Bill Harris, a professor of internal medicine at the Sanford School of Medicine at the University of South Dakota, who was not involved in the new research. “Don’t blame the omega-6s, it’s not their fault — it’s the lack of omega-3 fatty acids that’s the problem,” said Harris, who is also the president and founder of the nonprofit Fatty Acid Research Institute in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Both omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential for human health. However, your body cannot make them on its own and must create both from the foods you eat. Omega-3s — found in high quantities in fatty fish such as salmon as well as flaxseeds and chia seeds, pecans, walnuts and pine nuts — maintain your body’s cells, provide energy, maintain immune defense and reduce inflammation when it’s at optimal levels (like most things, too much omega-3may be harmful).

These molecules stimulate hair and skin growth, regulate metabolism, boost bone health, and in some cases may even beanti-inflammatory. However, omega-6s can also be converted into molecules such asprostaglandinsthat signal the initiation of inflammation — not a bad thing when your body is trying to quickly repel an invader or tumor, but devastating if left smoldering for long periods without resolution. Colorectal cancer was traditionally a disease of the old, but no longer. Cancer of the rectum and large intestine is on a deadly march among people as young as age 20, with diagnosed cases continuing torise among those younger than 50in the United States and around the world. Millennials, who were born between 1981 and 1996, have twice the risk of colorectal cancer compared with those born in 1950,according to a February 2017 study. For younger men, this type of cancer is the most deadly; for younger women, colorectal cancer comes in third behind breast and lung cancer, theNational Cancer Institutestates on its website. Related articleCancer cases in younger people are rising sharply. Here are some preventive measures to take Experts aren’t entirely sure what’s behind the increased risk: Genetics play a role, but the disease is appearing in younger patients with no family history, gastroenterologist Dr. Robin Mendelsohn told CNN in aprior interview. Rising obesity could explain the rise, but some young patients are vegetarians and exercise fanatics, said Mendelsohn, codirector at the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Mounting evidence, however, shows a link between an unhealthy diet high in ultraprocessed foods, red meat and processed meats such as ham, bacon, sausage, hot dogs and deli meat — as well as a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables —to early-onset colorectal cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. In the new study, researchers used colorectal cancer tissue harvested from 80 patients in the US and compared the tumor with normal colon tissue taken from the same patient. The goal: to identify specialized pro-resolving mediators, produced by the body from omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), during the resolution phase of acute inflammation. These specialized pro-resolving mediators include resolvins, lipoxins, protectins and maresins, which have potent anti-inflammatory effects that help inflamed tissues return to normal once the need for an inflammatory response is over. Related articleHidden belly fat linked to brain inflammation and dementia, study finds “There are two components to healing from injury or infection,” Yeatman said. “First, the immune system fights the infection with inflammation, like a fever, and then resolves that inflammation with specialized pro-resolving mediators created from derivatives of omega-3s.” However, omega-3 mediators only come into play when the body is fighting inflammation and are therefore often difficult to detect during the initiation of inflammation, said study coauthor Dr. Ganesh Halade, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of South Florida. To overcome that obstacle, Halade said he used a highly sensitive analytical technique to identify trace amounts of different mediators from omega-3 in the cancer tumor samples while also measuring levels of omega-6. “This is the first study to see in a comprehensive way how the molecules coming from omega-3 and omega-6 behave in the cancer tumor and normal control tissue from the same patient,” Halade said. “We found the control tissue has a perfectly fine balance of molecules from omega-6 and omega-3,” he said. “However, we found a tremendous imbalance in the tumor microenvironment — omega-6 fats coming from ultraprocessed foods were making more proinflammatory molecules inside the cancer tumor, but not in the control tissue.” Bottom line: Without enough omega-3s available to help control the inflammatory reaction created by the body’s response to cancer, inflammation continues to rage, further damaging cell DNA and prolonging an environment conducive to the cancer’s growth. Related articleAn imbalance of two healthy fats affects your early death risk, study finds “The researchers are basically saying there’s so much omega-6 around that it gives the cancer tumor a chance to just take off, and I think that’s probably correct,” said analytical chemist Tom Brenna, a professor of pediatrics at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the new study. “As linoleic acid increases in the body, it decreases the amount of two omega-3s, EPA and DHA, in the body’s tissue,” Brenna said. “And Americans don’t get enough omega-3s as it is, so the implication of the study is that if a person has too much omega-6, they likely need to boost their omega-3 to counteract that impact.” Try to obtain as many omega-3s from your diet as you can, experts say. The omega-3s  EPA and DHA are found in fatty fish such as anchovies, salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, sea bass, bluefin tuna and trout. Oysters and mussels are also good sources, according to theAmerican Heart Association. Eat two servings a week that are about 3 ounces, or about ¾ cup, of flaked fish, the AHA said. Some types of fish, typically larger species such as tuna, contain higher levels of mercury or other environmental contaminants so be sure to vary the types of seafood you eat to reduce risk. Related articleWhat is the healthiest fish to eat? The best choices for you and the planet Another important omega-3, alpha-linolenic acid or ALA, is found in nuts and seeds such as walnuts, flaxseeds and chia seeds — with ground flaxseeds and flaxseed oil providing the highest amounts, according to Harvard Medical School’swebsite. Try sprinkling ground flaxseed or chia seeds on granola and yogurt, and snack on small quantities of nuts during the day. A good-quality fish oil supplement may also help. There can be side effects from supplementation, such as bad-smelling breath and sweat and headaches, as well as digestive issues such as heartburn, nausea or diarrhea, Harvard’s site stated. Because omega-3s have anticoagulant effects, experts say it’s always best to check with your doctor before you start taking omega-3s (or any supplement). Suggested limits for various omega-3s vary byage and health conditions— another good reason to check with your doctor.","Health, Everyday"
Are you stretching correctly? What to do pre- and post-workout,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/health/best-workout-stretches-wellness/,"Editor’s note:Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. As you head into the gym, you likely already have a workout plan in mind. Maybe you’re taking a light jog on the treadmill, or you’re working on some bicep curls on arm’s day. To get the most out of your gym session, consider first how you start and end your workouts. Muscles need time to warm up, and stretching helps circulate more blood to those areas, allowing for a greater range of motion and flexibility. More flexibility increases performance, especially when doing actions that require bending, contraction and pulling. Stretching also helps lower the risk of injury. “A lot of people like to jump right into the workout, but stretching before and after is what’s going to determine how effective your workout can be for today and the next time you do it,” said Whitney Houlin, a personal trainer and director of training and fitness at WeGym in West Hartford, Connecticut. If you want better results or are hitting a plateau in your fitness journey, try adding dynamic and static stretching to your next workout. Related articleHow to make friends with the plank exercise for core strength Dynamic stretching involves moving a joint through its full range to increase flexibility, Houlin said. Static stretching involves holding a single position for several seconds. Static stretches can be passive or active. Active static stretches involve working a muscle while using other muscles to hold the stretch, Houlin said, such as lifting a leg in front of you using leg and core strength. Passive static stretches involve extending a muscle using gravity or other stretching tools. This technique can look like folding forward to stretch the hamstrings, allowing gravity to pull the upper body down. Researchers have produced conflicting results when it comes to the best pre-workout stretch. For example, a well-citedAugust 2003 studyshowed evidence of static stretching for warm-ups worsening muscle performance, while aNovember 2019 reviewfound the opposite, with static stretches boosting muscle strength for the average person getting into shape. More recently, researchers have been warming up to dynamic stretching. AnOctober studylooking at athletic performances found dynamic stretches were better for pre-workout than static stretching because they reduce the risk of injury. AnApril reviewof workout routines found dynamic stretching produced a greater range of motion in the lower limbs along with improvements in force and power in those areas. Physical therapist Dr. Mario Mejia recommended dynamic stretching before a workout because it prepares the body for intense activity. The active movements in dynamic stretches mimic the same movements you’re going to impose on the body when exercising. Related articleKnee pain in the US increased 65% over the past 20 years. Easy exercises can help “I’m a big dynamic stretch guy because that’s how we move,” said Mejia, who serves patients at      Fox Rehabilitation in Rockville Centre, New York. “If you’re healthy, you’re never really standing still.” Likewise, people at the gym are not usually holding one position — they often perform compound movements such as running and squats that require moving multiple joints at the same time. Dynamic stretches create the range of motion needed for these active movements and increase nerve activity in the muscles, readying them for movement. Mejia recommended taking five to 10 minutes to perform dynamic stretches before a workout. One of Houlin’s favorite dynamic pre-workout stretches is what she calls the world’s greatest stretch. “It’s one of my very favorite ways to warm up. It’s a good universal one too for lots of different exercises,” she added. Starting from a standing position, hinge at the hips and walk your hands out into a plank position. Be mindful to engage your core for stability and balance. Next, step a foot next to one hand like a big runner’s lunge and lift the other hand off the floor. When you rotate the upper body, the dynamic stretch will give a nice twist through the midsection. Afterward, put your hand back on the floor, step the foot back to a plank position and walk your hands back to the feet to roll yourself back up to standing. A second stretch Mejia recommended is alternating betweenforwardand reverse lunges. Additionally, half-kneeling windmills help with spine rotation, build core strength and stabilize hips and shoulders. Related articleAlleviate the ache and strengthen your knees with the reverse lunge To do ahalf-kneeling windmill, you’ll want to get into a half-kneeling position with one leg behind and the other leg in front. Take a kettlebell in the same arm as the leg in front of you and raise it overhead. Your gaze should stay on the kettlebell, not in front. Push hips back on the same side holding the kettlebell and lower the opposite forearm to the ground before driving your knee down to return to the initial position. Static stretches are best after a workout to get the body back to a state of rest, Houlin said. Cooldowns after high-intensity activity helps gradually bring the heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure back down to normal. “Stretching the muscles I just exercised gets blood flow back to those muscles to start the muscle repair process,” she said. Additionally, Houlin emphasized performing stretches that target the muscles stressed out during exercise. Related articleThe best resistance bands in 2024, tried and tested (Courtesy CNN Underscored) Mejia added that static stretching at cooldown also increases muscle elasticity, reducing the chances of muscle pain and stiffness. “During an activity like running, you are contracting and elongating muscles for a sustained period of time,” he said. “When you hold a static stretch at the end of a workout, you’re stretching the muscle fibers from their origin to the insertion.” Origin refers to a site where the muscle attaches to a bone that remains stationary during a contraction, and insertion refers to a site where a muscle attaches to a bone that moves during a contraction. Thepigeon poseis a static stretch Houlin highly recommended for post-workout. You’re on the ground with your front leg in a 90-degree bend at the knee with the back leg extended behind you. She said it’s a great stretch for hip flexors and glutes. Mejia recommendedhamstring stretches,calf stretchesand a standing quad stretch. Thequad stretchtargets the quadriceps and hip flexor muscles as you stand on one leg and bend the knee of the other leg while grabbing the opposite foot, pulling it toward your rear. You should hold each static stretch for 15 to 30 seconds for two to four sets, Mejia said. “This is adequately enough to produce the elongation effect and improve range of motion.” Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series.Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.

What your peeing frequency can say about your health,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/health/how-often-you-should-pee-wellness/,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being. How oftenone should poophas been a hot topic, with experts saying the numerical range partly depends on several personal factors. But is there a similar prescription for how frequently you should pee? The answer is yes, experts say — and veering too far outside of this range in either direction likely warrants a close look atyour lifestyle habitsand health status. During the day, most healthy people pee about six to eight times, said Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt, a urologist at Orlando Health and CNN contributor. “For most, it’s reasonable to need to pee every (three to four) hours during the day,” Brahmbhatt added via email. “At night, ideally, you’re only getting up once or none. If you’re waking up more often, it could mean something’s off.” Related articleWhat the color of urine tells you about your health Some people may pee up to 10 times per day, especially if they’re drinking a lot of water or other beverages that cause more frequent urination, Brahmbhatt said. Those can include alcohol, tea and coffee, which have diuretic effects and irritate the bladder, said Dr. David Shusterman, a board-certified urologist at NY Urology in New York City. (If these effects of coffee or alcohol annoy you, try drinking less or making the coffee half strength with extra water, and the cocktail with less alcohol and more of the mixer ingredient, he recommended.) “Honestly, everyone’s a little different, so there’s no magic number that works for everyone,” Brahmbhatt said. “If it’s hot and you’re sweating a lot, you might pee less. The important thing is knowing what’s normal for you. If you’re suddenly running to the bathroom way more — or way less — it might be worth checking out, especially if it’s messing up your quality of life.” Excessive urination that’s not due to copious water or beverage consumption can have multiple causes, including overactive bladder syndrome, diabetes, a urinary tract infection or medications, Brahmbhatt said. Diuretic medications, often prescribed for blood pressure or heart conditions, are a common contributor. Urination is controlled by a complex neurological system that involves signals sent between the bladder, urethra and brain, said Dr. Jason Kim, clinical associate professor of urology at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island, New York. Accordingly, excessive urination can also be caused by stroke, spinal cord injuries andsome neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and central nervous system tumors. Pregnancy is another factor, since it requires drinking much more water and thus more water metabolism happening, Shusterman said. Related articleWhat causes travel constipation and how to fix it Stress or anxiety can also make someone need to pee more, Kim said, as the fight-or-flight response or release of adrenaline can cause the bladder to contract or increase urine production, respectively. An overactive bladder can result from hormonal issues, too, such as genitourinary syndrome of menopause, Kim said, which is a collection of symptoms caused by decreased estrogen levels. “Interestingly enough, it’s thought that there are estrogen receptors in the bladder,” added Kim, who is also director of the university’s Women’s Pelvic Health and Continence Center. “So, a lot of times we will add vaginal estrogen cream or suppositories to the patient’s regimen, and it’s been shown to help with overactive bladder.” If your peeing pattern bothers you or if you’re regularly waking up at night to pee, see a urologist who can help you determine what’s going on and potentially start bladder training exercises. That specialist may refer you to a pelvic floor therapist if your problem seems to be due to pelvic floor dysfunction, Kim said. There are several other minimally invasive treatments available, experts said, including medications, bladder Botox injections and types of nerve stimulation, Kim said. The injections help weaken the bladder’s nerves so “the bladder wall doesn’t contract as much, therefore downregulating how much your body has to go to the bathroom,” Shusterman said. The procedural interventions tend to be much more effective than medications, Kim and Shusterman said. On the flipside, peeing only every six to eight hours, or fewer than four times daily, could mean you’re dehydrated or that there’s an issue with how your bladder or kidneys are working, Brahmbhatt and Shusterman said. Related articleDoctors say it’s fine to pee in the shower Abnormally high levels of calcium can lead to bladder stone formation and block urine from exiting, Shusterman said. Regarding hydration, theNational Academy of Medicinerecommends women consume 2.7 liters (91 ounces) of fluids daily, and that men have 3.7 liters (125 ounces) daily. This guideline includes all fluids and water-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables and soups. Since theaverage water intakeratio of fluids to foods is around 80:20, that amounts to a daily amount of 9 cups for women and 12.5 cups for men. Not peeing enough can increase your risk of harboring bacteria in your urethra and therefore developing UTIs, since peeing regularly is the body’s primary mechanism for preventing UTIs, Shusterman said. If your infrequent peeing is because you’re holding it, that habit could harm your health by increasing your risk ofmultiple issues such askidney infections or weakened bladder muscles from constant straining. If you have your lifestyle habits down pat but still aren’t peeing enough, that also calls for seeing a urologist or subspecialist in voiding dysfunction, the medical term for issues with bodily functions that excrete waste. One thing a doctor would assess is whether the cause is obstructive or nonobstructive, Kim said. “Urinary retention from obstruction is when, for example, the urethra is blocked and the urine can’t get out,” he explained. “Nonobstruction is more some kind of a holding behavior, when in men, as they age, almost invariably, every male’sprostate grows in sizeand oftentimes is a cause.” Related articleAre you in perimenopause? Here’s what to look for, according to a doctor For aging women, that retention may be from a tightening urethra, Shusterman said. Reduced urinary function, too, can be the result of the same aforementioned neurological diseases or injuries. Unfortunately there aren’t as many treatments for underactive bladder, Kim said, except forself-administered intermittent catheterization,long-term catheterizationand sacral neuromodulation,a bladder pacemaker. These procedures can be life-changing, he added, so if you need help, don’t wait to seek it.",Health
"Democratic attorneys general prepare to duel Trump in court, again",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/politics/democratic-attorneys-general-donald-trump/,"When the frequent court foes of Donald Trump’s first administration look back at the early days of his presidency, they recall “building the airplane as we were flying it,” as outgoing Washington Attorney General Bob Fergusonhas described it. That was especially true of the intense and quick-moving court fight over the so-called travel ban, a seminal 2017 lawsuit that set the tone for four more years of legal confrontations. None of the Democratic state attorneys general who originally took Trump to court over that controversial policy will still be in office when he is inaugurated next month. But their successors won’t be starting from scratch this time around, even amid a different legal landscape and political climate from Trump’s first term in office. They have been preparing for months, if not years, for what kind of lawsuits they might want to bring against a Trump 2.0 agenda. They’ve done so as the president-elect and his deputies have promised a more sophisticated and less error-prone operation this time. Related articleDemocratic governors and AGs prepare for battle with Trump administration Democratic officials and their staff have pored over Trump’s campaign promises as well as the proposals outlined in Project 2025, the policy handbook assembled by a conservative think tank that was written by several veterans of the Trump’s first administration, some of them now nominees for his second. They’re adjusting the legal strategies that were used against Trump during the first go-around to take into account shifts in court precedent since then, while also acknowledging a political reality that gave Trump a more decisive electoral win than in 2016. “There was a much clearer voice of the people. And one of the jobs I have is to understand what’s behind that,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser told CNN. “Insofar as the administration pursues policies that are lawful, that’s their right to pursue lawful policies.” In some states, the current attorneys general have been serving in the role since the back half of Trump’s first presidency — giving them more than a taste of what litigating against his administration is like. Others have inherited office staff who helped craft the marquee legal challenges of his first term, and four Democratic attorneys general will be serving in states where their governor held that role in the last Trump presidency. The planning has involved internal briefs laying out different litigative options for challenging certain Trump proposals, as well as analysis of how recent court precedents should weigh on those decisions. Washington’s attorney general-elect, Nick Brown, has been reading up on how key legal doctrines such as standing have shifted since the first Trump administration. The day after the Supreme Courtoverturned Roe v. Wadein 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta asked his staff to draft potential strategies for how his state could challenge a national abortion ban. Democrats are anticipating sharp battles over mass deportation, abortion access, the environment and consumer protection, among other issues. Compared to Trump’s 2016 campaign, the president-elect and his allies have been “a little bit more predictable with specifics,” Bonta said. “We expect him to do what he says,” added Bonta, who was in the California legislature during the first Trump presidency. “We’ve been through this once at 1.0 and understand a lot of the places where he broke the law.” During the first Trump administration, the number of state-brought legal actions against the federal government totaled in the triple digits, and those court fights made national stars of those officials leading the legal resistance. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was the state’s attorney general in 2017, was on the 2024 Democratic vice presidential short list. The Democratic governors in Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, and, come January, in North Carolina and Washington, are former attorneys general who battled the first Trump administration in court as well. They bring to the governor’s mansion knowledge and experience of how to duel with Trump in court — experience that will benefit the lawyers serving in their current roles. As governors, they can help secure funding and propose other legislation that will buttress the work of state attorneys general. Having former Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey in the governorship for the second Trump term is “actually critical,” the commonwealth’s current attorney general, Andrea Joy Campbell, told CNN. Ferguson, who was elected Washington’s governor, joined his successor, Brown, at a post-election news conference last month at which both Democrats said threats of revenge by Trump would not influence decisions to bring cases. Trumpreportedlysat on a Washington request for wildfire disaster aid in 2020 — a request that ultimately fulfilled when President Joe Biden took office. “If people are being harmed, if the law is being violated, we should enforce that, without fear of retribution,” Brown said. But that does not mean that Democratic attorneys general plan to fight Trump on every issue. They told CNN that, while they will probably disagree with many of his policies, they’ll only sue when the legal circumstances warrant it. It’s a needle they will have to thread while trying to work with the Trump administration on other issues that have had bipartisan support, such as addressing the opioid crisis or bringing antitrust actions against social media companies. The day-to-day of law enforcement typically requires coordination between state and federal agencies as well. “My office has been able to partner at the local level with these agencies, and I want to preserve that, regardless of who’s president,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN. “I am not going to lash out for the sake of lashing out.” He and other attorneys general emphasized, however, that when they believe that the incoming president has violated the law in a way that is harming residents of their states, they are committed to taking him to court. “To the extent that there was a strong mandate here for the administration, it was specifically on cost of living,” said Josh Kaul, the attorney general for Wisconsin, which went for Trump this year. “I don’t think a lot of folks who voted for the Trump administration did so because they wanted people’s rights to be taken away.” Asked for comment for this story, Trump transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that “President Trump will serve ALL Americans, even those who did not vote for him in the election. He will unify the country through success.” The relationships that state attorneys general forged among themselves during the first Trump administration continued through the Biden years, and several months ago, those cross-state conversations turned to Trump’s possible return. Part of those discussions has been understanding which state is best suited to take the lead on a legal challenge, perhaps because of its expertise on the issue, how the policy uniquely affects its residents or where the state sits on the federal circuit court map. The Democratic Attorneys General Association — an organization that had just a handful of employees at the beginning of the first Trump term but now numbers 40 among its staff — organizes regular Zoom calls and in-person confabs to keep the dialogue going. The discussions for a potential second Trump term began in earnest at the organization’s February conference in Seattle, DAGA president Sean Rankin told CNN. At a conference in Philadelphia two weeks after the election, the organization carved out time for the current and incoming Democratic attorneys general to speak to one another in private, without the presence of DAGA staff, and another in-person conference is planned for February, weeks after the inauguration. One issue the attorneys general must confront is how recent changes in law and in the judiciary will weigh on their legal calculus. The Supreme Court is more right-leaning now than it was at the start of Trump’s first term, with his installation of three justices. One of them, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, replaced the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the end of 2020. Meanwhile, lower court judges, taking cues from the high court, have been more hesitant to issue the sort of nationwide injunctions that blocked Trump policies throughout the country in a single case. On the flip side, however, is a series of Biden-era Supreme Court rulings that require courts to give more scrutiny to actions taken by executive agencies,including one 2024 rulingthat reversed longstanding deference that judges gave to how agencies interpreted vague laws. Democrats say they intend to see those precedents applied fairly, even if they have been critical of how the court’s conservative wing has undermined federal regulatory power. Related articleDemocratic governors quietly prep extensive plans to counter Trump “They have made their bed, and they’re going to have to lie in it,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong told CNN. “And if there’s no deference to the EPA under Lee Zeldin, or to the Department of Homeland Security under Kristi Noem, then there’s no deference.” Where the biggest courts fights will play out will likely shift as well. The US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the long-favored venue of Democrats that covers the Western swath of the country, is not as nearly liberal as it was at the beginning to the Trump administration after he appointed 10 judges to the court. The First Circuit, covering the upper Northeast, will likely be the safest bet for Democrats, as it currently has no Republican appointees among its active judges after Biden’s judicial overhaul. Amid all these changes, Democrats are quick to bring up the win rate that their offices had during the first Trump administration, with some states prevailing in 80% or more of the cases they brought against his first-term agenda. That courts so frequently found that Trump had run afoul of the law makes the attorneys general confident that they’ll be successful again in the legal battles they pick with his second administration, even in a different judicial landscape. “The circuits have changed. The Supreme Court has changed,” New Jesey Attorney General Matthew Platkin told CNN. “But they’ve also sided with the rule of law in many instances, and I predict they will again.”",Politicsy
Pictures show Joe Biden meeting Hunter Biden’s Chinese business partners,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/28/politics/hunter-biden-joe-biden-business-partners-photos/,"Newly released pictures show then-Vice PresidentJoe Bidenmeeting some of his son Hunter Biden’s Chinese business partners during an official visit to the country, as well as Hunter meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior officials. This is the first time these images have been made public, even though the photo ops and meetings they depict have been known about for years. The National Archives and Records Administrationreleased the imagesafter apublic records requestfrom a pro-Trump right-wing legal group. The photographs are from Joe Biden’s visit to China in 2013. In one set of images, Hunter Biden is seen, along with his father, meeting and chatting with Xi. In another set of images, Joe Biden introduces his son to Li Yuanchao, who was China’s vice president at the time. Another group of pictures shows Hunter Biden introducing his father to his Chinese business partners, some of whom were executives at the private equity firm BHR Partners. After handshakes and hugs, the Bidens posed for a group picture with a few of the Chinese businessmen. These images are notable because they further undercut Joe Biden’s already-diminishedunequivocal assertionsthat he never had any business-related contact with his son. In fact, the House Republicans’impeachment inquiryinto Joe Bidenuncovered at least two dozen interactions between him and his son’s business partners from China and other countries. However, Hunter Biden and others involved have testified that — despite occasional phone calls, meet-and-greets and dinners with Joe Biden — business was never substantively discussed. Hunter Biden’s formermain US business partnerlater testified that Hunter wasselling the “illusion”of access to his father, but “nothing of material was discussed” during these interactions. Hunter Biden’s attorney Abbe Lowell criticized the Trump-aligned groups that fought to obtain and release the images, saying in a statement, “There is simply nothing new here.” “The photos match perfectly to Hunter’s congressional testimony description of who he saw at this public event during a 2013 trip to China,” Lowell said, referring to Hunter Biden’s closed-door deposition in February, during which he wasgrilled by Republicansfor six hours. “These attacks trying to twist these images into something they are not is just more of the same old tired, misinformation spin from some Republicans who can’t let go of their ridiculous conspiracy theories and baseless accusations,” Lowell said in the statement. America First Legal, a pro-Trump group, filed the records request in 2022 and later sued the National Archives to obtain the records. The group is led byStephen Miller, who served inPresident-electDonald Trump’s first White House and is set to return next year as deputy chief of staff for policy. “These photos corroborate the House Oversight Committee’s investigative findings that Hunter Biden arranged for his father to meet with Jonathan Li and other BHR executives during the 2013 China trip, where ‘Mr. Li sought — and received — access to Vice President Biden’s political power,’” America First Legal said in a news release Monday. Asked by CNN about the newly released images, a White House spokesperson said, “This trip — which occurred over a decade ago — is old news. House Republicans already wasted years and millions of taxpayer dollars proving that the President was not in business with his son. It’s past time to call it a day.” Hunter Biden’s foreign business deals drew intense scrutiny from Hill Republicans and Justice Department investigators. Federal prosecutorscharged him with tax crimespartly stemming from unpaid taxes from his overseas deals. He was never accused of corruption or illegal lobbying,despite GOP claimsthat he engaged in criminal influence-peddling. In a controversial postelection move, Joe Bidenpardoned his sonfor the 12 tax and gun crimes he was convicted of earlier this year. The sweeping pardon also shielded Hunter Biden from future prosecution for any potential federal crimes he may have committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. “Even while President Biden has pardoned his son, Hunter, for anything and everything ‘he has committed or may have committed or taken part in’ going all the way back to the year 2014, more evidence comes out each day showing how his family leveraged Joe Biden’s even longer career in public office for private gain,” Michael Ding, counsel for America First Legal, said in a statement.

Attention DOGE: Here’s how the federal government spends Americans’ tax dollars,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/28/politics/government-efficiency-musk-federal-budget-dg/,"As the co-heads of the newly createdDepartment of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are promising to slash at least $2 trillion from the federal budget. The duo, who are tasked with recommending cuts to the incoming Trump administration as outside advisers,have citedareas they’d like to target. They includethe Internal Revenue Service, theDepartment of Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And they want to take a hard look at foreign aid, defense spending and the inaccurate payments the government sends to Social Security recipients and others. But taking that big a chunk out of federal spending would be a tall order, experts say. Much of the money supports mandatory programs, which must be funded in accordance with existing laws. These include Social Security and Medicare benefits and interest on the federal debt. Less than one-third of the federal budget in fiscal year 2024 consisted of discretionary spending, which Congress approves annually. Nearly half of discretionary spending goes toward defense programs, which are a sacred cow for many lawmakers. “$2 trillion a year is such an absurdly large number, it’s impossible,” said Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Here’s where your taxpayer dollars go: Musk and Ramaswamy have also repeatedly said they could downsize thefederal workforceby forcing employees toreturn to the office, which they hope would prompt many of them to quit. Fewer than half of federal civilian workers are eligible to telecommute, and those that can still spend a majority of their working hours in their offices. Both Musk and Ramaswamy have assailed federal workers as bureaucrats who oversee anever-growing web of regulations. “The power of the unelected Federal bureaucracy has grown to become an unconstitutional ‘FOURTH BRANCH’ of government!” Muskposted on Xearlier this week. “Especially with the creation of their own internal court system, it has become the most powerful branch of government. We must fix this!” But the federal workforce is about the same as it was 50 years ago, even though the federal government oversees more programs and provides more benefits. Under former President Bill Clinton, the headcount dropped by more than 400,000 as he sought to“reinvent” the government, according to Elaine Kamarck, founding director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Effective Public Management. Also, he was able to take advantage of the crumbling of the Soviet Union to trim the Department of Defense. But the September 11 attacks put a halt to the downsizing in 2001, and the government has beefed up its intelligence and homeland security workforces since then. While many people may think the federal workforce is concentrated in Washington, DC, and the surrounding metro areas, that’s not the case. “Federal employees are providing services to the public everywhere,” said Max Stier, founding president and CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, which advocates for an effective federal government.

Musk’s MAGA opponents claim he stripped them of X badges,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/27/tech/maga-musk-x-visas/,"The debate roiling the MAGA world in recent days over visas for highly skilled workers shows no signs of abating. Some prominent online personalities are now accusing Elon Musk of using his social media platform, X, to retaliate against those who disagree with his support of the H-1B visa program. Musk, who was tapped to lead President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, hasclashed with Trump supportersover H-1B visas. While Trump has taken aim at the visas, Musk - the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX - has defended the program and argued that tech companies need foreign workers to compete. Related articleMusk and Ramaswamy defend foreign worker visas, sparking MAGA backlash “If you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be,” Musk wrote on X, saying inanother poston Thursday that “bringing in via legal immigration the top ~0.1% of engineering talent” is “essential for America to keep winning.” But loyal Trump backers like far-right activistLaura Loomer, conservative punditAnn Coulterand former Rep. Matt Gaetz have criticized Musk and his incoming Department of Government Efficiency co-chair Vivek Ramaswamy, over their pro-H-1B visa stance. Musk, in turn, stripped Loomer and other members of the right-wing Conservative PAC, of their verification badges, members of the PAC said. Loomer, a far-right provocateur anda vocal Trump supporteron Thursday claimed that Musk had removed her verified status on X and shut down her ability to gather paying subscribers because of her opposition to the H-1B program. Musk, she posted, “is a free speech fraud.” CNN has reached out to Loomer and X for comment. Loomer has more than 1.4 million followers on X. It is not known how much money Loomer was making through the paid subscriber service on the platform. Before she lost her verified badge, Musk posted that “Loomer is trolling for attention.” Preston Parra, the chairman of Conservative PAC, told CNN that approximately 53 accounts affiliated with his organization lost their verified badges, including Loomer. “If anyone thinks for one minute the REAL backbone of the right wing and MAGA is gonna stand idly by while these big tech gillionaire Silicon Valley dweebs who didn’t get bullied enough in high school, steal our country, they’re mistaken,” Parra said in a statement.

Six former Florida State players suing coach Leonard Hamilton over failed NIL payments,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/sport/six-former-florida-state-players-suing-coach-leonard-hamilton-spt/,"Six former Florida State basketball players sued Seminoles coach Leonard Hamilton on Monday, alleging he failed to make good on a promise to get each of them $250,000 in name, image and likeness compensation. The plaintiffs — Darin Green Jr., De’Ante Green, Cam’Ron Fletcher, Josh Nickelberry, Primo Spears and Jalen Warley — filed suit in Leon County circuit court. Their attorney, Fort Lauderdale-based Darren Heitner, shared the 20-page complaint with The Associated Press. Yahoo Sports first reported the case. The former players allege Hamilton promised them the money from his “business partners.” The lawsuit says they walked out of a practice last season over the missed payments and intended to boycott a February 17 game against Duke. They ended up playing — the Seminoles lost 76-67 — amid a guarantee from Hamilton that they would be paid but never were, according to the suit. No attorney for Hamilton was listed in the lawsuit. FSU hosts Syracuse on Saturday. The complaint includes multiple text-message exchanges between players and some between players and Hamilton. FSU finished 17-16 last season, including 10-10 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The 76-year-old Hamilton is in the final year of his contract. The Seminoles are 9-4, including 0-2 in league play. None of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit remain with the team. Green and Nickelberry exhausted their college eligibility last spring, and the four others transferred. Spears is now at UTSA, Fletcher is at Xavier, De’Ante Green is at USF and Warley is at Gonzaga. The lawsuit is the latest in a growing number of NIL legal battles. Matthew Sluka, a starting quarterback for the UNLV football team, left the program after three games in September because he was never paid a $100,000 NIL deal. Former Florida quarterback signeeJaden Rashada, now playing at Georgia, sued Gators coach Billy Napier last year over an unpaid $13 million NIL deal. And several Tulsa players claim they were never paid thousands in NIL commitments made by former coach Kevin Wilson.",Sports
‘An indictment on the entire system’: NYC subway killing renews focus on the nation’s homelessness crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/us/nyc-subway-woman-fire-homeless-crime/,"It’s been a week since a woman died in a New York City subway car, allegedly set on fire by a homeless, undocumented man. She has yet to be identified and the man charged with her murder says he doesn’t even remember being there. The crimehas renewed focus on a set of multilayered and inextricable issues felt almost daily in America’s biggest city: homelessness, crime and the nation’s broken immigration system. The killing’s gruesome details and videos from the scene spread quickly on social media, leaving lawmakers in New York to highlight the city’s failure to provide housing, address the ongoing mental health crisis and improve public safety. Both suspect and victim rode the F train to the end of the line in Brooklyn last Sunday, a frequent practice by homeless people seeking to take shelter from the cold at night. Once the train arrived at the station, authorities said the suspect, Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, walked over to the victim and using a lighter to set her ablaze. As the woman burned alive, Zapeta-Calil appeared to watch from a platform bench while bystanders recorded video and police struggled to put out the flames. Zapeta-Calil, who arrived in the United States from Guatemala in 2018, had also recently checked in and out ofhomeless sheltersacross the city. Zapeta-Calil’s last recorded residence, according to police, was a shelter in Brooklyn which offers help to people with substance abuse disorders. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced a grand jury indictment against Zapeta-Calil on Friday, charging him with first- and second-degree murder and arson. Gonzalez said investigators in his office, the New York City Police Department and the city’s medical examiner’s office are still working to identify the victim. “Just because someone appears to have been living in a situation of homelessness does not mean that there is not going to be family devastated by the tragic way she lost her life,” Gonzalez said. Brooklyn Councilman Justin Brannan, a Democrat who represents parts of Coney Island, said homeless people routinely ride the subways to the end of the line stations to seek shelter from the elements and during the overnight hours. They are usually met by outreach workers who try to coax them into accepting city services and shelter, but the offers are often rejected. Brannan, whose district includes two end-of-line stations, said the constant presence of homeless individuals and their frequent refusal of city services is evidence the city’s approach to the homelessness crisis is not working. “The fact that so many people seek refuge in our subway system is a testament to how bad the shelter situation is,” Brannan told CNN. “Someone would rather spend the day riding the subways back and forth instead of accepting shelter – that is an indictment on the entire system.” Crime rates in the city’s subway system have decreased by 10% since New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rolled out asubway safety initiativein March, according to data provided by Hochul’s office. The plan included additional resources for mental health services, a plan to install surveillance cameras across the entire train system and the deployment of National Guard officers. Overall, crime has declined by 42% since January 2021. Related articleNew York City set to bolster police presence in the subway system as part of efforts to crack down on transit crime Still, multiple high-profile incidents involving homeless individuals and other passengers – including some which have resulted in fatalities – have continued to feed anxiety among city residents and commuters about thesafety of the system. “Our subways have become this de facto mental health facility,” Brannan said. The subway might look different for people depending on what hour they ride the trains, which run 24 hours, nonstop every day of the year. “The reality on the subways is very different from the rush hour commute and the off hours. Someone who commutes after 11 p.m. or before 5 or 6 a.m. is seeing a very different reality while they’re on that train,” he said. More than 225,000 migrants have come through New York City since the spring of 2022, according to numbers provided by City Hall. Since then, Mayor Eric Adams’ administration has spent more than $6 billion to meet the city’s housing obligation,struggling to provide shelterto every migrant who arrived in the city. Related articleNew York City Mayor Eric Adams calls for changes to NYC sanctuary policy As a right-to-shelter jurisdiction, New York City is legally mandated to provide shelter to any homeless person in the city who needs it. The legal requirement has forced the city to look beyond its typical shelter options – resorting to hotels, park fields and a web of shelter providers. Zapeta-Calil had recently bounced around the city’s shelter system, according to senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation. The multiple shelter stays likely reflect the city’s 60-day rule for single migrant men. The policy allows men to stay in a shelter for a maximum of 60 days before needing to reapply or leave the shelter system altogether. While much of the focus has been on Zapeta-Calil’s immigration status and the graphic nature of the crime, homelessness advocates said the case also highlights the struggle by state and local government to provide housing and services to people in dire need of them. Dave Giffen, executive director for the Coalition for the Homeless, the country’s oldest homeless advocacy and service organization, told CNN the attack underscores how deeply entrenched the issue is in the city. “What is frustrating about all this is that when these horrible incidents happen and homeless people are victimized or in the rare instance that they are the perpetrator, they are used for political purposes rather than doing something to provide permanent housing and services,” Giffen said. Further proof of the acute nature of the nation’s homelessness crisis was outlined in a Department of Housing and Urban Developmentreport released Friday, showing the number of people experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2024 as the highest ever recorded. The data show more than 770,000 people experienced homelessness on a single night across the country in 2024. The number represents an increase of 18% over the last year and the largest annual increase since the count began in 2007. Related articleHomelessness hit a record high in the US this year Roughly 23 of every 10,000 people in the United States “experienced homelessness in an emergency shelter, safe haven, transitional housing program, or in unsheltered locations across the country,” the report said. Homelessness increased significantly across many of America’s biggest cities, driven by the affordable housing crisis, rising inflation and increased numbers of immigrants to the United States. Natural disasters also contributed, as well as the end of pandemic era homelessness prevention programs. According to the New York City Department of Homeless Services’ daily census, more than 86,000 people in New York City were housed in the shelter system as of Friday, including more than 32,000 children. The nature of the injuries suffered by the still unidentified victim has made the identification process extremely difficult, but investigators with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office are working to trace the steps the woman took that day before she ended up sleeping inside the train. Gonzalez said they are also using advanced DNA and fingerprinting technology. “We’re working on trying to go back and trace when she entered the subway system and exactly – if there’s a clear shot of her face,” Gonzalez said Friday. Giffen told CNN the difficulty in identifying the victim so far underscores how homeless people become invisible to everyone around them. He said homeless people typically have a hard time holding on to important documents and identification because they are always moving from place to place and their belongings are often stolen. “Especially around the holiday season it just underscores what a tragedy this is – we have become so used to seeing human beings sleeping in public spaces that it’s not surprising we have forgotten who they are,” Giffen said. “The level of dehumanization is tragic and it’s something that likely happened long before this tragic act of violence.”",Society
At least 4 dead as severe weather threat moves east after tornado-spawning storms hit Texas and Mississippi,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/weather/tornado-storm-southeast-east-coast-sunday/,"At least four people have died as severe thunderstorms batter the Southeast and East Coast on Sunday after deadly tornado-spawning storms tore throughTexas and Mississippi, ripping off roofs and flattening homes. A high school student in Natchez, Mississippi, died after a tree fell on a home, Adams County emergency officials said Saturday.A second fatality was reported in Mississippi’s Lowndes County,state emergency officialssaid on Sunday.Another person died in northern Brazoria County, Texas, where a tornado touched down in four separate locations, according to Sheriff Bo Stallman. A fourth person was killed when a tree fell onto a vehicle in North Carolina on Sunday, Iredell County Sheriff Darren Campbell told CNN. Crews were still conducting searches and assessing the damage from Saturday’s storms as the severe weather took aim at the Southeast. Cities from north Florida to the Carolinas could see damaging wind gusts, large hail and tornadoes on Sunday. A line of severe thunderstorms will continue to charge eastward and will be capable of spawning tornadoes, quarter-sized hail, and 70 mph winds, the Storm Prediction Center said. “The faster-moving northern part of a line of strong-severe thunderstorms will move northeastward across the watch area through midday, offering sporadic damaging to severe gusts and potential for a few embedded tornadoes,” the prediction center said. It’s the same line of storms responsible for more than 150 storm reports Saturday, including more than 30 reported tornadoes. “Severe thunderstorms and embedded heavy rainfall will affect most of the eastern states through Sunday,” the National Weather Service warned. A severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for parts of eastern South Carolina and central North Carolina until 5 p.m. This watch includes Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Raleigh and Wilmington, in North Carolina. Parts of southern Georgia, north Florida, and the Carolinas are under tornado watches as severe storms charge east with damaging winds and isolated tornadoes.

A trailer that had been secured on Peterson’s property had been blown into the property next door and destroyed. A tornado touched down in multiple locations within a small area in Brazoria County and had a quick impact, according to Sheriff Bo Stallman. “The damage has been extremely devastating,” he said. Officials in Brazoria County were working to accommodate teachers and students at Walt Disney Elementary School, after it took storm damage, according to Manvel Mayor Dan Davis. Davis shared a photo from inside the school in aFacebook post, which shows significant damage to the school’s ceiling and debris scattered around the floor. “Recovery efforts across the area have commenced and I’m grateful to live in a County where the people truly care about one another,” Davis said in the post. “Over the next few days, properties will be cleared, power will be restored, and lives will start to be rebuilt. Please keep praying for all of those impacted!” Residents in Montgomery County, about 80 miles north of Brazoria County, are also recovering from a possible tornado in their community. “There was a two-story house right (across the street) that is no longer there,” he said. Things went from “bad to worse” for Bill Hustus, who toldKHOUthat strong winds caused trees to fall on his house, and destroyed a home in his community. Tornadoes are much less common in the US during December, averaging only around 40 – compared to the nearly 270 seen on average in May. This year, however, there have been 1,783 tornado reports as of December 27 – well above the average of 1,347 reports.

The oldest living survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor dies at 105,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/28/us/warren-red-upton-dies-pearl-harbor-survivor/,"Warren “Red” Upton, a 105-year-old World War II US veteran who wasthe oldest living survivorof the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, died on Christmas Day, according to his family and the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors, a veteran’s organization. Upton was a “very humble, gentle, soft-spoken man,” who was “well-read and well-informed with current affairs,” Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors, told CNN. “Warren never considered himself a hero,” Farley said. “He said: ‘A lot of people would consider the survivors of Pearl Harbor “heroes,” but if you ask anybody, the real heroes are the ones who never made it home,’” Farley recalled. Upton passed away at a hospital in Los Gatos, California, early Wednesday morning, after suffering a bout of pneumonia for several days, said Farley, who said she’s been in constant contact with the veteran’s family. Barbara Upton, 57, told CNN she and her brother were with their father in the hospital at the time of his death. “He was a very good and humble man, and a little bit shy,” Upton’s daughter said. “He and my mom have always taught us good values.” Upton was also the last surviving crew member of the battleship USS Utah, one of the seven ships sunk during the attack on December 7, 1941, according to Farley. Related articleWreck of US Navy’s heroic ‘dancing mouse’ WWII warship found off Australia With his death, there are 15 survivors of Pearl Harbor that are known to still be alive, Farley said, adding there were 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack. Upton’s death came nearly three weeks after the 83rd anniversary of Pearl Harbor and two months after he celebrated his 105th birthday in mid-October, according toFriends of the National World War II Memorial. The last time Upton went to Hawaii was in 2019, when he attended a remembrance ceremony at the USS Utah Memorial, Farley told CNN. Born on October 17, 1919, in El Dorado, California, Upton served as a Navy radioman aboard the USS Utah, according to Farley and Upton’s daughter. The USS Utah was a Florida-class dreadnought battleship that was moored off Ford Island at Pearl Harbor when Japanese forces attacked the Hawaii naval base in the early morning of December 7, 1941, according to theNational Park Service. The attack, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously described it as “a date which will live in infamy,” prompted the US to declare war on Japan the following day. Upton, then 22, was shaving aboard the Utah when he felt the first torpedo hitting the battleship, herecalledduring his 99th birthday celebration in 2018. A few seconds later, a second torpedo hit, causing the ship to list and capsize. The crew was forced to abandon ship and swim for land. The Utah quickly rolled over and sank, with58 of its crew dead that day. A total of 461 crew members, including Upton, survived, according to theNational Park Service. Upton recalled swimming towards Ford Island after escaping the ship. While in the water, he helped a fellow crew member who couldn’t swim reach shore. Upton, who got the nickname “Red” for his natural thick, red hair, recalled the man shouting at him, “Red, do you know how to swim?” Related articleA legacy of valor: Only 16 Pearl Harbor survivors remain. On the 83rd anniversary, they still share stories of heroism After reaching Ford Island, Upton said he jumped into a ditch, which was originally being dug up for sewer pipes, to take cover from attacking Japanese warplanes. Upton sheltered in the ditch until a flatbed truck came in and took him to safety, he said. Upton continued to serve as a radioman throughout the war and later served in the Korean War, according to Farley. He converted to Catholicism during his time in the Navy, his daughter said. After the war, Upton returned to California, where he worked as secretary of Pearl Harbor Survivors Chapter 7 in San Jose, where he facilitated meetings and reported deaths of survivors from his chapter. Upton raised a family with his wife, Valeria Gene Parker, a former Navy nurse who joined more than 11,000 women in the Navy Nurse Corps during the war, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Parker passed away in 2018, according to herobituary. She was 97. “He mourned his wife’s death every single day,” Farley said. While Upton’s funeral arrangements are pending, his final wishes were to be buried side-by-side with his wife instead of being interred within the USS Utah’s wreckage, a solemn yet optional tradition among Pearl Harbor survivors, according to Farley. “Warren told me a few years back, ‘Kathy, I was lucky enough to make it off the ship. I’m not going back there again,’” Farley told CNN. Upton is survived by his five children and several grandchildren, according to Farley. Upton was one of the few surviving World War II veterans in the United States, where the population of the “Greatest Generation” is rapidly declining. Of the 16.4 million Americans who served, only 66,143 – less than 1% – are still alive today, according to theNational WWII Museum in New Orleans.

"Miles-long anchor drag mark found on Baltic seabed after suspicious cable damage, Finnish investigators say",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/europe/baltic-sea-cable-anchor-drag-russia-intl-latam/,"Finnish investigators probing the damage to aBaltic Sea power cableand several data cables said they found an anchor drag mark on the seabed, apparently from a Russia-linked vessel that has already been seized. The discovery heightened concerns about suspected sabotage byRussia’s“shadow fleet” of fuel tankers – aging vessels with obscure ownership acquired to evade Western sanctions amid thewar in Ukraineand operating without Western-regulated insurance. The Estlink-2 power cable, which transmits energy from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down on Dec. 25 after a rupture. It had little impact on services but followed damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage. Finnish police chief investigator Sami Paila said late Sunday the anchor drag trail continued for “dozens of kilometers (miles) … if not almost 100 kilometers (62 miles).” Paila added to Finnish national TV broadcaster Yle: “Our current understanding is that the drag mark in question is that of the anchor of the (seized) Eagle S vessel. We have been able to clarify this matter through underwater research.” Without giving further details, Paila said authorities have “a preliminary understanding of what happened at sea, how the anchor mark was created there,” and stressed that the “question of intent is a completely essential issue to be clarified in the preliminary investigation.” On Saturday, the seized vessel was escorted to anchorage in the vicinity of the port of Porvoo to facilitate the investigation, officials said. It is being probed under criminal charges of aggravated interference with telecommunications, aggravated vandalism and aggravated regulatory offense. Related articleNATO to boost Baltic Sea presence after power, internet cable damage The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but was described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union executive commission as part of Russia’s shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Russia’s use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage. In the wake of the cable rupture, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that the military alliance, which Finland joined last year, will step up patrols in the Baltic Sea region. The Finnish Coast Guard said Monday that another tanker ship headed for a Russian port has engine failure and drifted, then anchored in the Gulf of Finland south of the Hanko Paninsula. The guard said it was notified Sunday night. Registered in Panama, the M/T Jazz was en route to Primorsk, Russia, from Sudan, with apparently no oil cargo. Finnish authorities have dispatched a tugboat and a patrol ship to ensure that the vessel does not drift and to prevent any damage to the environment. Regional director of the Coast Guard Janne Ryönänkoski said there was no immediate risk to the seabed infrastructure. Earlier Monday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that “sabotage in Europe has increased” since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Kallas told the German newspaper Welt that the recent “sabotage attempts in the Baltic Sea are not isolated incidents” but “part of a pattern of deliberate and coordinated actions to damage our digital and energy infrastructure.” She vowed that the EU would “take stronger measures to counter the risks posed” by vessels of Russia’s shadow fleet. Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) border with Russia, abandoned its decades-long policy of neutrality and joined NATO in 2023, amid Russia’s war against Ukraine.",World
"Iran confirms arrest of Italian journalist, state media reports",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/middleeast/iran-confirms-arrest-cecilia-sala-intl/,"Iran has confirmed the arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala, state news agency IRNA said, citing the Iranian Ministry of Culture. Italy’s foreign ministry said in astatement Fridaythat Sala was detained in Tehran. IRNA said Monday that Sala had been detained on December 19 after “violating the laws of the Islamic republic of Iran.” “Her case is currently under investigation. Her arrest was carried out in accordance with the relevant regulations, and the Italian Embassy in Tehran has been informed,” IRNA said, citing the Iranian Ministry of Culture. The reporter was visited in prison Friday by Italian Ambassador Paola Amadei “to verify the conditions and state of her detention,” the statement said, adding that she had previously been allowed to make two phone calls to her relatives. “We still don’t know the charges,” Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told journalists on Saturday. Until Saturday, a lawyer had not visited Sala in prison, the foreign minister added. “We hope that (the lawyer) will be able to do so in the next few days and that he will be able to know the exact charges as soon as possible,” Tajani said. Sala was reporting in the Iranian capital when she was “stopped by Tehran police” on December 19, the Italian foreign ministry statement said, adding that the foreign ministry “has worked with the Iranian authorities to clarify the legal situation of Cecilia Sala and to verify the conditions of her detention.” Sala is a reporter for theItalian daily Il Foglio, which says the journalist is being held in Tehran’s Evin prison. According to Il Foglio, Cecilia was in Iran “on a regular visa to report on a country she knows and loves,” while noting its repression of free speech and threats against journalists. The publication’s editor, Claudio Cerasa, wrote in the paper on Friday: “Journalism is not a crime. Let’s bring Cecilia Sala home.” The Italian outlet Chora Media, where Sala also works, said Friday that she had left Rome on December 12 “with a valid journalistic visa and the protections of a journalist on assignment. “She conducted several interviews and produced three episodes of the Stories podcast for Chora News,” said the media outlet, adding that it had not made Sala’s detention public sooner as her parents and Italian authorities had asked it to remain silent, hoping for the journalist’s swift release.",World
Germany accuses Elon Musk of trying to influence its election,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/europe/germany-elon-musk-election-influence/,"The German government accused US billionaireElon Muskon Monday of trying to influence its election due in February with articles supporting the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, even though it suggested they amounted to “nonsense.” Musk, who is set to serve Donald Trump’s new administration as an outside adviser, endorsed the AfD as Germany’s last hope in a guest opinion piece for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that prompted the commentary editor to resign in protest. “It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election” with X posts and the opinion piece, a German government spokesperson said. Musk is free to express his opinion, the spokesperson said, adding: “After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.” Musk, the world’s richest person, has defended his right to weigh in on German politics because of his “significant investments,” and has praised the AfD’s approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation. His intervention has come as Germans prepare to vote in a parliamentary election on February 23 after the collapse of the coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk also called for Scholz’s resignation after a car rammed into a crowd at aChristmas marketon December 20, killing five people. The AfD is currently in second place in opinion polls behind the main opposition conservatives, and might be able to thwart a center-right or center-left majority in the election. Germany’s mainstream parties have pledged not to work with the AfD at the national level. The government spokesperson said Musk’s endorsement of the AfD was “a recommendation to vote for a party that is being monitored (by domestic intelligence) on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and which has already been recognized as partly right-wing extremist.” German politicians have excoriated Musk for his endorsement of the AfD, with the co-leader of Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) comparing him to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Both want to influence our elections and specifically support the AfD’s enemies of democracy. They want Germany to be weakened and plunged into chaos,” Lars Klingbeil told the Funke news group on Monday. Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats and current favorite to succeed Scholz as chancellor, told Funke that Musk’s comments were “intrusive and pretentious.”","World, Politics"

On Friday, Israeli forces raided the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, putting some 75,000 Palestinians remaining in the north of the enclave at risk,the United Nations said.They also arrested the hospital’s prominent director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, accusing him of being a suspected “Hamas terrorist operative.” The raid has rendered the hospital “empty” of patients, some of whom are critically ill, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Those in critical condition were transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, “which is itself out of function,”WHOsaid. Some patients were also transferred to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, WHO added. The UN saidthat WHO is planning a mission to the Indonesian Hospital to move the evacuated patients to southern Gaza for continued care. Mohammed Salha, director of Al Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, which is barely functioning and severely damaged due to recent airstrikes, told CNN Monday that Kamal Adwan Hospital is “totally out of service” and that his own medical facility has very little fuel and is overflowing with patients, despite limited supplies. “We have one surgeon who is only performing when a case is in a life-threatening situation,” Salha told CNN. “The health system in the north is completely deteriorated,” he said. “We are working to save what is left.” Salha said his hospital must wait for approval from the Israeli military to allow the Red Cross to move cases that require specialist treatment from the north of Gaza further south. The raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital came amid renewed Israeli aerial and ground operations in several parts of northern Gaza, aimed at targeting what the IDF called a resurgent Hamas presence in the area. The onslaught has left streets as carpets of debris, killed entire families, and severely depleted food, water and medical stocks. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) over the weekend said it had detained at least 240 “Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists” around the hospital, alleging the facility was being used as a “Hamas terror stronghold.” It said Monday that troops had also “operated to identify and eliminate multiple terrorists in the area overnight.” On Saturday, after detaining the hospital director, Dr Abu Safiya, the Israeli military claimed that the facility was being used by Hamas as a “command and control center.” The military did not provide any evidence to support the claims. Abu Safiya’s arrest was met with outrage by Palestinians, the UN and rights groups. Amnesty Internationalon Sunday called him “the voice of Gaza’s decimated health sector,” adding that since the war, “Israel has detained hundreds of Palestinian healthcare workers from Gaza without charge or trial.” In a statement on X, Amnesty said that “health workers have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment and been held in incommunicado detention” by Israel. As Gaza’s northern hospitals are forced out of service, aid is barely reaching the few hundred thousand Palestinians still trapped in the area. Since October 6 of this year, when Israel’s concentrated operation in the north began, 5,565 truckloads of aid have entered the enclave, according to data from the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Since December 1, Israeli authorities have denied 48 of 52 UN attempts to coordinate humanitarian access to northern Gaza,OCHA said on December 24,adding that the “four approved movements all faced impediments.” OCHA’s databasesays that on December 26, 27 truckloads of aid entered Gaza. There are no records of aid into the enclave after December 26, according to the UN database. Jonathan Whittall, acting head of office at OCHA,said on Mondaythat his team has been denied entry into northern Gaza more than 140 times. “We don’t have the ability to provide the level of assistance that is needed to meet the most basic requirements,”Whittall said in a video posted on X. “The basics of human survival are being destroyed in Gaza,” he said. However, the IDF said on Saturday that prior to its weekend operation against Kamal Adwan in north Gaza, it evacuated patients and delivered “tens of thousands of liters of fuel, food, and medical supplies.” According to COGAT,the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza, one fuel truck went to northern Gaza for the refueling of bakeries, the group said on Monday. The multiple humanitarian crises in Gaza – food shortages, lack of shelter and medicine – have been compounded by a snap of cold weather. Gaza’s Health Ministry said a 20-day-old newborn died from the cold, the fifth in the last week. One surgeon in Gaza, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta, said on X that hypothermia, malnutrition and injury represented the triad of death. “In Gaza this means that people will die of hypothermia at higher temperatures, will starve to death much quicker and will succumb to less severe wounds,” he wrote.

The best plants for cleaning indoor air,https://www.cnn.com/wbd/the-best-plants-for-cleaning-indoor-air/,"We spend a lot of time indoors, making healthy indoor air quality a top priority. An oft-citedNASA Clean Air Studyfrom 1989 found that some indoor plants can reduce indoor air pollutants, including formladehyde. Great news for lovers of houseplants like pothos, pictured above! Well, a more recent study by the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology concluded that, while indoor plants do purify the air,they do so at a rate too slowto make much of a difference. Still, every bit helps, right? And do we really need another reason to fill our homes with natural beauty? Read on to find out the top air-purifying plants that aid in the removal of pollutants such as formaldehyde, benzene, trichloroethylene and carbon monoxide. Remember: Some plants and plant parts can be toxic. Keep them out of the reach of children and pets. Chamaedorea seifrizii Since the bamboo palm, or reed palm, prefers part sun or shade, it makes a great houseplant with the added benefit of aiding in the removal of harmful elements such as benzene and formaldehyde. Aglaonema modestum The Chinese evergreen is an easy-care plant that thrives in low to medium light. It generally grows to 1 or 2 feet. Though it helps to maintain healthy air quality in the home, it is important to note that the Chinese evergreen contains an irritant that can be toxic to pets. Gerbera jamesonii When placed indoors, this popular annual is useful in removing benzene and providing mood-enhancing beauty to the home. However, keep in mind that the gerbera daisy does best in warm temperatures, at 75 degrees or higher. Spathiphyllum ‘Mauna Loa’ Known for its ability to fight against toxic gases such as formaldehyde and carbon monoxide, peace lilies are relatively easy to care for and even show signs of drooping when they need to be watered. They can be mildly toxic to pets and humans, so it’s important to wash your hands after touching the plant. Chlorophytum comosum ‘Vittatum’ This easy to care for houseplant thrives in bright, indirect light and works hard to remove the air of harmful pollutants like formaldehyde and benzene. Spider plants dislike soggy soil, so let them dry out slightly between waterings. Dracaena fragrans ‘Massangeana’ Proven to help remove formaldehyde from the air, the mass cane/corn plant is one of the most popular varieties of Dracaenas for its lovely foliage that ranges from green to yellow. They look stunning in tree form but can also be grown as shrubs. Ficus elastica Rubber trees have been shown to absorb and break down harmful chemicals in the air. Their large, glossy leaves also take in the carbon dioxide we exhale and convert it to oxygen. Grow them in well-drained potting soil, water regularly and apply liquid fertilizer when they’re actively growing. Epipremnum aureum Pothos earned high marks in a NASA clean air study for clearing the air of benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, carbon monoxide and xylene. These vining tropicals tolerate low light, although it may make their leaves revert to solid green. Use them in hanging baskets or containers and let them trail over the edge of a table. Chamaedorea elegans Parlor palms, popular during the Victorian Era, are still popular today, thanks in part to their ability to adapt to the low light conditions found in most homes. According to NASA’s study on plants that clean the air, they can also remove benzene and trichloroethylene from your home or workplace. Rhapis excelsa Known as broad lady palm or broadleaf lady palm, this plant can reduce the ammonia found in some indoor cleaning products. It also filters out benzene, nitrogen oxide, formaldehyde, xylene and toluene. Tolerant of low light, these palms can grow to six feet tall, so they’re ideal for dim corners. They like moist soil but need good drainage. Ficus benjamina NASA found that ficus trees, or weeping figs, improve indoor air by removing pollutants like formaldehyde and xylene. Weeping figs are very sensitive, and their leaves can turn yellow and drop when you move them to a new location or change your watering habits. The leaves usually grow back when the plant adjusts. Most ficus like bright indirect or filtered light. Give your plant high humidity and wait until the top of the soil is dry before watering. Anthurium andraeanum This evergreen plant, red anthurium, is also known as flamingo lily for its flamboyant flowers. Researchers for NASA’s Clean Air Study report it can cleanse indoor air of ammonia, toluene, xylene and formaldehyde. Anthuriums need bright, indirect light and high humidity, so mist them regularly and keep their soil moist, but not soggy.",Everyday
A vegan cheese that actually tastes good? Thank this ancient fungus,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/food/vegan-cheese-formo-innovation/,"It’s a problem as intractable as the riddle of the Sphinx: How do you make a vegan cheese that people actually want to eat? Formo, a Berlin-based biotechnology company, thinks it has found the answer in a minuscule fungus, Koji, that has given that distinctive umami flavor to soy sauce, miso and other staples of Japanese cuisine for thousands of years. Formo ferments the Koji to produce a protein that provides the base of its dairy-free cheeses. Raffael Wohlgensinger, Formo’s co-founder and chief executive, started the company five years ago to create cheese sustainably, using less land, water and producing less planet-heating emissions than traditional dairy farming for milk-based cheeses. It was also born from his frustration with the current range of vegan cheese products in stores. “Being Swiss, and being a big cheese lover, (I was) disillusioned with everything,” he told CNN. Related articleKraft’s newest Mac & Cheese is ditching cheese He is not alone.In recent years, consumers have flockedto dairy-free substitutes for cow’s milk, guzzling its oat and almond-based cousins, for example, and to plant- and fungus-based meats, such asburgers. But shoppers have not taken to vegan cheeses with the same enthusiasm, according to Carmen Masiá, an application scientist at Novonesis, a Danish biotech firm producing the bacteria and enzymes needed to make fermented foods like yogurt and cheeses. Sales of plant-based milks in the US rose by more than 1%in 2023, according to the San Francisco-based Plant Based Foods Association, whereas sales of plant-based cheeses fell 9%. Masiá, who has researched consumer trends around vegan cheese as part of her doctorate, said that the most common bases for these cheeses, such as coconut fat, fail to lend that recognizably “cheesy” flavor or texture. “It’s a block of fat… It feels rubbery. It doesn’t feel like a dairy cheese in the mouth.” “If you talk with vegans or vegetarians or flexitarians, most of (them) say, ‘I cannot give up on cheese’ because it’s so difficult to replicate that flavor,” she added. “The code has not been cracked yet.” Masiá said the current crop of vegan cheeses generally do “not deliver” what consumers want. “If you go to a café, you can always find oat milk and even people who are not really vegan, many times they choose oat milk because it’s tasty.” She can’t imagine shoppers’ preference for milk-based cheese shifting dramatically anytime soon, but says fermentation — aprocessusing bacteria, yeast or other microorganisms to break down and transform food, such as turning milk into yogurt — offers a way to improve vegan cheeses. “In the end, if you develop something that is really sustainable, really nutritious but it doesn’t taste good, people are not really going to buy it.” Formo’s cheeses seem to have finally tickled some tastebuds. In September, the company secured $61 million during its latest funding round and announced that it would begin selling some of its products — three flavors of cream cheese — in more than 2,000 stores across Germany and Austria. Wohlgensinger said the partnership with REWE, BILLA and METROsupermarketswas a “massive” moment for the company. He is gearing up for a wider roll-out of Formo’s products in Europe next year and in the US in 2026. So, what’s the secret sauce? Formo has put its own spin on fermentation to make its cheeses: It puts a strain of the Koji fungus into a tank, adds oxygen, and stirs in sugars and nutrients to cultivate proteins in large quantities. It calls this process “mi﻿cro-fermentation”. The proteins are siphoned off and dried to create a powder that forms the base of Formo’s products, which also include blue and feta-style cheeses. The Koji protein gives Formo’s cheeses a “creaminess” that is hard to emulate using plant proteins, which are structured differently and can often feel “grainy” in the mouth, said Wohlgensinger, adding that the taste is a closer approximation to milk-based cheese. In “all the (cheese) products based on cashews or soy, you taste cashew or soy, (and in) the products based on potato, you taste potato starch,” he said. Wohlgensinger said that he believes Formo is the first to ferment Koji for cheese. He hopes the method will eventually become the default among food producers. Formo is also testing a process called precision fermentation, which uses microorganisms that have been genetically engineered to produce proteins identical to the casein proteins found in animal milk. These copycat proteins can help give Formo’s vegan cheeses the taste, texture and “meltability” of traditional cheese, according to the company. “If you think about the nice stretchiness of a mozzarella on your pizza, that is really coming down to the protein structure of casein,” Wohlgensinger said. Formo is in the process of getting the cheeses produced via precision fermentation approved for sale by food regulators in the US and Europe. Securing approval for these cheeses is a complex process partly because the production process is novel, Wohlgensinger added. “We’re not here to put small-scale dairy farmers out of their business — they will always be a very valuable part of a very diverse, resilient food system — but at the same time, I think there is a very big chunk of the market… that is bound to be replaced by a more efficient technology,” he said. Animal agriculture is responsible foraround 12%of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, making it a significant contributor to climate change. Cows have a particularly significant impact because they producemethane, a potent planet-heating gas. Formo hopes that as it scales its production it can lower its retail prices to below those of milk-based cheeses. Now, 100 grams of Formo’s cream cheese product costs €1.59 ($1.68), making it €0.32 ($0.34) more expensive than the average price of milk-based cream cheese, Wohlgensinger said. Still, the company must contend with deeply entrenched preferences among cheese lovers. Dairy-based cheeses have a unique “crave-ability,” according to Julie Emmett, vice president of marketplace development at the Plant Based Foods Association, that has made it harder for its dairy-free alternatives to truly compete, unlike plant-based milks. “You can’t necessarily say that milk is crave-able. You can say meat is crave-able. But with cheese, it is unique in that respect, (it’s) something that’s an indulgence,” said Emmett. Still, Novonesis’s Masiá, said that fermentation may just be the answer for dairy-free cheese makers, infusing their products with the “cheesy notes” consumers are looking for. Increasingly, food producers are requesting batches of Novonesis’ bacterial cultures to produce cheese via this process, she added. “People are opening their eyes and thinking ‘OK, microbes can help us’,” she said.

Google’s new AI tool uses image prompts instead of text,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/business/google-ai-whisk-image-prompts/,"Google’s newest artificial intelligence tool, “Whisk,” lets people upload photos to get back a combined, AI-generated image – even without users inputting any text to explain what they want. Users can input images depicting subjects, setting and style before Whisk combines everything into one image. Whisk is a “creative tool” for quick inspiration, Google said in ablog post, as opposed to a “traditional image editor.” In essence, Whisk is intended as a fun AI feature, rather than as something that’s supposed to be refined professional work. Big Tech companies like Google and OpenAI are racing to release consumer products that can showcase uses for the snazzy new technology, even as naysayers warn that the lack of guardrails around the development of AI poses dangers for humanity. Since OpenAI initially launched its text-to-image creation tool, Dall-E, in 2021, the concept of AI-generated artwork hasswamped social mediaand become a focus of consumer products. Google’s Whisk is an image-to-image generator, building upon the popular concept of text-to-image generators. People using Whisk can “remix” the final image by editing their inputs and mixing the categories to produce different imageslike a plushie toy, enamel pin or sticker. Users can add in textif they want to direct certain details, but it is not required to create an image. “Whisk is designed to allow users to remix a subject, scene and style in new and creative ways, offering rapid visual exploration instead of pixel-perfect edits,” Thomas Iljic, a director of product management at Google Labs, said in a statement. Google’s Whisk is built upon the generative AI developed by DeepMind, the AI lab that Google acquired in 2014. Whisk works by using Google’s core AI offering, Gemini, which debuted in December 2023, and pairing it with Imagen 3, the latest text-to-image generator released by DeepMind in December. When users upload their images, Gemini generates a caption which is fed into Imagen 3. The process captures the “essence” of the subject as opposed to an exact replica, which allows for remixing the final image but also means the end product might stray from the prompt. For example, the generated image might have a different height, hairstyle or skin tone as the prompt images, Google said in ablog post. When Googlefirst rolled outGemini’s text-to-image creator in February, the company faced initial backlash because the tool produced historically inaccurate images. Whisk is first available as a website on Google Labs for users in the US and is in its early stages of development, the company said. Related articleGoogle and Samsung are taking on Apple and Meta with their own mixed-reality headset OpenAI also recentlyreleaseda text-to-video generator called Sora, highlighting the competition for consumer products. Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told CNN that Whisk is another “flex the muscles moment” for Google in the AI and tech race. “DeepMind is a key asset for Google,” Ives said, noting that AI products are a part of Google’s “treasure chest” of new products for 2025, which also include a new Android operating system built in collaboration with Samsung and Qualcomm.","Technology, Business"
Bird at center of worst one-species mortality event in modern history isn’t recovering,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/26/science/alaska-heat-wave-murres-global-warming/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. A marine heat wave has killed approximately half of Alaska’s common murre population, marking the largest recorded die-off of a single species in modern history,research has found. The catastrophic loss points to broader changes in marine environments driven bywarming ocean temperatures, which are rapidly and severely restructuring ecosystems and inhibiting the ability of such animals to thrive, according to a new study. The Northeast Pacific heat wave, known as “the Blob,” spanned the ocean ecosystem from California to the Gulf of Alaska in late 2014 to 2016. Related articleUS wildlife officials move to add iconic monarch butterfly to threatened species list The event is considered the largest and longest known marineheat wave, with temperatures rising by 2.5 to 3 degrees Celsius (4.5 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal levels, said Brie Drummond, coauthor of the study that published December 12 in the journalScience. Common murres, or Uria aalge,are known for their distinctive black-and-white feathers, resembling the tuxedoed look of penguins. These predators play a critical role in regulating energy flow within the marine food web in the Northern Hemisphere. While murres have experienced smaller die-offs in the past as a result of environmental and human-induced factors, they typically recover quickly when favorable conditions return. However, the magnitude and speed of the die-off during this heat wave was particularly alarming to Drummond and her team. The researchers determined the scale of this catastrophic population loss by tracking extreme population declines at 13 colonies across the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea that have been monitored long-term. By the end of the 2016 heat wave, Drummond and her team counted more than 62,000 common murre carcasses, which only accounted for a fraction of those lost since most dead seabirds never appear on land. From there, biologists monitored the rate at which common murres were dying and reproducing and found no signs of the colonies returning to their previous size. “The only reason we had this data and were able to detect this (event) was that we had these long-term data sets and long-term monitoring,” said Drummond, a wildlife biologist at the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. “(Monitoring) is the only way we’ll be able to continue to look at what happens in the future.” As temperatures in Alaska rose, the murres’ food supply dwindled, with one of their primary prey, Pacific cod, plunging by about 80% between 2013 and 2017, the study revealed. With the collapse of this key food source, about 4 million common murres died in Alaska within the period from 2014 to 2016, the researchers estimated. “There are about 8 million people in New York City, so it would be like losing half of the population … in a single winter,” Drummond said. Before the start of the 2014 heat wave, Alaska’s murre population made up 25% of the world’s population of the seabird species. However, when comparing the seven-year period before the heat wave (2008 to 2014) with the seven-year span following (2016 to 2022), the study found the murre population in 13 colonies spread between the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea declined anywhere from 52% to 78%. Drummond and her colleagues continued monitoring the murres from 2016 to 2022 after the end of the heat wave but found no signs of recovery. Related articleCalifornia squirrels are eating another rodent for the first time, new study finds While further research is necessary to fully understand why murres are not bouncing back, Drummond’s team believes the changes are driven by shifts in the marine ecosystem, especially those associated with food supply. Reproductive challenges and relocation difficulties also may be contributing to the species’ lack of rehabilitation, according to Dr. Falk Huettmann, an associate professor of wildlife ecology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who was not involved in the study. Unlike some other species, seabirds such as murres take a longer time to reproduce, making repopulation a slower process, Huettmann said. Additionally, Huettmann noted that murres are bound to the colonies they reside in, and as they are forced to relocate, it can be more difficult to adjust to new conditions. While temperatures continue to rise in areas such as Alaska, tropical or subtropical waters are moving into different areas, Huettmann said, which creates conditions for an entirely new ecosystem. With these environmental shifts, animals will either adapt or be unable to survive in the new climate. Murres are not the only species in Alaskan waters undergoing significant changes. Huettmann noted thetufted puffin, a sensitive marine bird, has been seen migrating north because of poor conditions in southern areas of the North Pacific, including California, Japan and Russia, yet it’s struggling to adapt to its new home. King salmon, whales and crabs are other species grappling with finding their place, he said. While heat waves have affected many species, other populations aren’t substantially impacted, Drummond said. Related articleWild dolphins off US Southeast coast found with microplastics in their breath, study says Half of the data collected from organisms such as phytoplankton and even homeothermic top predators presented “neutral” responses to the heat wave. Twenty percent of these apex predators even responded positively to the abnormal heat exposure, according to the study. Homeothermic animals, including birds and mammals, have stable internal body temperatures regardless of the environmental temperature. “That gives us perspective on which species might more readily adapt to these kinds of warming water events in the future and which will not,” Drummond said. Although rising temperatures are the primary factor affecting animals like murres, other elements also may be contributing to marine life changes. “From an ecological perspective …microplastics, ocean acidification, sea levels rising and chronic oil spills … are other massive mortality factors at play,” Huettmann said. However, studies tracking the long-term effects of climate events on marine life are limited, so scientists are still uncertain about how these animals will continue to be impacted in the future.",Science
Trump’s energy strategy is ‘drill baby drill.’ It’s going to be much harder than that,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/climate/trump-energy-oil-gas-nuclear-wind-solar/,"President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a three-word energy policy: “Drill, baby, drill.” But his cabinet picks for energy and environment — and the current fossil fuel economy — suggest it’s not going to be that easy. There is no question that, in stark contrast to the climate-focused Biden administration, the people Trump is surrounding himself with will carry out the fossil fuel industry’s wish list to juice oil production and demand for its products. They are poised to roll back regulations that favor electric vehicles and fuel-efficient hybrids and approve Gulf Coast projects to liquefy and ship natural gas abroad. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump’s new energy czar and pick for Interior Secretary, will oversee much of this work alongside Chris Wright, a Colorado-based natural gas fracking CEO and Trump’s pick for Energy Secretary. Both are staunch fossil fuel advocates, but each has also worked with clean energy. The oil industry boomed in North Dakota under Burgum’s tenure as governor, but electricity from windmore than doubledfrom 2015 to 2023, becoming North Dakota’s second-biggest electricity source, behind high-pollution coal. Wright runs a natural gas fracking company andonce drank fracking fluid— a cocktail of water, bleach and soap, to seemingly prove it wasn’t poisoning underground water sources. But he also sits on the board of an advanced nuclear energy company and has invested in a geothermal startup that is working to convert underground heat intoelectricity to powerhundreds of thousands of homes. Related articleBiden just unveiled America’s ambitious new climate goal. Trump will assuredly undo it Complicating the picture further is Elon Musk, CEO of America’s largest EV company, and one of Trump’s closest advisors, despite the president-elect’s apparent disdain for electric vehicles. But Musk’s influence on Trump’s energy policy is less certain, as he has been tasked with a new commission cutting government spending and agency jobs. Trump’s energy policy will also be impacted by the fast-changing energy landscape. Trump and his allies say they will open the nation’s oil spigots on full blast, but under the climate-focused tenure of President Joe Biden, US oil productionhas never been higher. And even though Trump has vowed to kill Biden’s signature climate law, its generous clean energy tax credits are leading to new EV and solar factories being constructed,supercharging red state economiesalong the way. This could make it harder to convince GOP lawmakers to go along. Another massive piece of the energy puzzle is electricity, which is in high demand as artificial intelligence, data centers and energy manufacturing facilities come online. Many of the biggest tech companies have vowed to use zero-carbon nuclear power. All of this means the energy picture looks vastly different than it did under Trump’s first term. “Everyone’s been viewing energy policy through the lens of the past couple of decades of: Republicans are (for) fossil fuels; Democrats are for clean energy and climate policy,” said Neil Chatterjee, who served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the first Trump administration. “I think we’re about to enter a new chapter.” Just days after Trump won the 2024 election, his transition team began drawing up plans for his energy policy, and how to roll back major elements of Biden’s climate legacy. The actions include withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement — something Trump did in his first term. The plans also include downsizing national monuments to increase drilling on public lands, and slashing government jobs and offices dedicated to cutting pollution in low-income communities, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN. Trump’s team is also planning further cuts to Biden’s climate and energy regulations, including several major EPA rules cutting pollution from vehicles and power plants. The Trump transition team didn’t respond to specific questions on the incoming administration’s plans. “When he takes office, President Trump will make America energy dominant again, protect our energy jobs, and bring down the cost of living for working families,” transition  spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

Trump’s picks look likely to undo this work. “The steps taken by the Biden administration have been way beyond anything we’ve ever seen in the past — not issuing leases; then when they issue leases, they basically issue leases where there wasn’t much interest,” said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, who has worked with Burgum. “What (Burgum) has seen is that these federal, duplicative burdens of regulations inherently impede the ability to produce energy.” The incoming administration is also focused on spurring demand for fossil fuels. This includes relaxing regulations on gas-powered vehicles and restarting federal permits for massive liquefied natural gas export terminals, paused this year by Biden’s Energy Department. LNG exports are a way for the US oil and gas industry to sell more natural gas to Europe, as wellas emerging marketsin Asia and South America. However, the LNG industry is urging Trump’s administration not to rush to immediately approve new terminals, taking its time to make sure any new permits can stand up in court. “All of this comes back to legal durability of any permit that they issue,” said Charlie Riedl, executive director for the Center for LNG, a trade group. “That’s, I think, what industry is after. We would obviously like to see our permits uphold court challenges.” What’s less clear is what Trump’s picks will mean for clean energy. Biden’s clean energy law massively benefits Republican congressional districts around the country, and Republicans could be sacrificing billions of dollars of private investment and thousands of jobs if they vote to repeal it. There are other big question marks beyond Biden’s climate law. Biden’s Interior Department, for instance, has permitted dozens of clean energy projects on federal lands and waters, including 11 approved offshore wind projects, which will be harder for Trump to claw back. But Trump’s administration could stop issuing future leases for offshore wind. The nuclear industry especially is hopeful that there will be more investment in its zero-carbon energy under Trump. Nuclear has enjoyed bipartisan support, and it’s getting major boosts from big tech companies that have signed agreements to source much of their power from nuclear energy. Microsoft took the step of reviving Three Mile Island – the Pennsylvania plant that was the site of America’s only nuclear meltdown in 1979. Nuclear has enjoyed billions of dollars in federal investments from the Biden administration and federal tax credits. The question is whether the Trump administration will continue to favor it – and fund it. “The general expectation is we’re going to see reduced federal spending” under Trump, Alan Ahn, deputy director for nuclear at think tank Third Way’s climate and energy program, told CNN. “The fact you have the big tech companies, they’ve made these big commitments, they’re going to carry weight with any administration. We’re going to need continued and robust public investment to continue to push that forward.” The scope of that investment remains to be seen — but the politics around nuclear and other forms of clean energy are not as clear-cut for Republicans as they used to be, Chatterjee said. “On the political right, there’s going to be a recognition that we can’t possibly meet the surge in (electricity) demand with fossil fuels alone,” Chatterjee told CNN.

Recognize the name Jolt Cola? The 1980s soda aims to make a comeback — this time with even more caffeine,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/business/jolt-cola-energy-drink-returns/,"Jolt Cola, the soda brand that gained attention in the 1980s for offering “all the sugar and twice the caffeine,” is heading back to stores in 2025. This time, it’s promising more than twice the original caffeine content. Once marketed as an alternative to Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Jolt Cola will now join the crowded energy-drink market with the likes of Red Bull, Monster and Celsius. It will be marketed as a nostalgic drink due to its past reputation, according to Redcon1, the sports nutrition brand leading the relaunch. “There’s a neat way to bring something back where it’ll pay homage to what once was, yet we can do it in a very modern way,” Ryan Monahan, chief marketing officer at Redcon1, told CNN. Jolt Cola will come in 16-ounce cans and be priced at about $2.50 or $3. It will have 200 milligrams of caffeine, up from around 70 milligrams in a 12-ounce can in 1985. This relaunch marks the third release in the United States for Jolt Cola. In 2009, the brand’s company filed for bankruptcy protection. Jolt Cola would briefly resurface on shelves at Dollar General stores in 2017 before the chain stopped selling it in 2019. When Redcon1 announced in October that it would reintroduce Jolt Cola, it could have brought it back as a soda. But growth in the energy-drink market has outpaced the soda market, prompting Jolt Cola to instead compete against the energy drinks that Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Dr Pepper have a stake in rather than those brands’ signature soda products. The energy-drink market has long been dominated by Red Bull, but beverage giants have found their way into the industry in recent years. In 2015, The Coca-Cola Company bought a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage Corp. PepsiCohas a major stake in energy-drink maker Celsius Holdings and acquired Rockstar Energy in 2020 for $3.8 billion. In October, Keurig Dr Pepper announced it would spend more than a billion dollars toacquire energy-drink maker Ghostby 2028. “Consumers pick and choose who wins with their dollars. The reality is, it’s the soda companies that we’re really seeing a decline in,” said Monahan. Market research group Imarcforecaststhe global energy-drink market will reach $48.1 billion in 2024 and grow to $80.8 billion by 2033. In contrast, total soft drink volumesgrew 1.3% from a year agoafter a decline for two decades, according to data from Evercore ISI. Redcon1 has partnered with IMG Licensing, which represented the owners of Jolt’s rights, ECC-Jolt, to make Jolt energy drinks. Monahan said they would release limited-edition flavors to increase interest instead of only sticking with a cola. The company may also launch energy shots, pre-workout drinks and other products, according to Monahan. Energy drinks have long faced backlash for their sugar and caffeine content, though public pressure has eased compared with the outcry over Jolt Cola in the 1980s. Consuming at least two energy drinks with about 200 milligrams of caffeine, or more than400 milligrams of caffeine daily, is considered excessive for most adults, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. While Jolt Cola’s 200 milligrams of caffeine may seem like a lot, it’s nowhere near the leader. Celsius HEAT packs a whopping 300 milligrams of caffeine for a 16-ounce can. Energy drinks can also pack a high amount of sugar. A typical energy drink contains about40 grams of it,according to Harvard University’s School of Public Health. That’s almost a day’s worth ofrecommended sugarfor someone with a 2,000-calorie diet, according to the Mayo Clinic. Redcon1 said Jolt Cola will offer azero-sugarbeverage, as well as added supplements. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages children from consuming caffeine, while the National Institutes of Health said marketing has led younger consumers to buy energy drinks forperformance boosts. Thousands of people, some of them children, receive emergency treatmentrelated to caffeine useeach year, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Monahan said Redcon1 doesn’t want to target its caffeine-filled drinks to anyone under 21. He added that Jolt Cola can attract older consumers looking for “old school nostalgia” and young adults interested in a “throwback.” “It’s that thing of, ‘I remember I wasn’t allowed to have it and it’s come back,’ or ‘I remember enjoying it and it went away,’” Monahan said.",Business
One of the oldest animals on Earth can fuse with another of its kind,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/science/comb-jellies-fuse-single-organism/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Late one summer night in 2023, Kei Jokura entered the marine biology lab at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts excitedly carrying a blob in a beaker. The biologist had just come from the first floor, where tanks held a colony of gelatinous comb jellies. The blob was bigger than others, and it looked as though two of the jellies had merged into one. “I couldn’t believe my eyes at first,” recalled Jokura, who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the UK’s University of Exeter. Related articleThe longest-living vertebrate could offer clues to extending the human lifespan, scientists say Mariana Rodriguez-Santiago, a postdoctoral researcher at Colorado State University, was working on her own project when Jokura appeared. “We were all amazed and astonished, thinking, ‘How can they fuse and still be swimming and moving around like a unit?’” she said. She grabbed a pipette and gently poked one of the jellies. It squirmed. Simultaneously, so did the one to which it seemed to be attached. “We thought, ‘Are they able to feel the same thing? Are they one individual? Two individuals? How can we disentangle this?’” she recalled. Over the next few weeks, Rodriguez-Santiago helped Jokura combine multiple pairs of the comb jellies, scientifically known as Mnemiopsis leidyi, to see what happened. The findings of the investigation led by Jokura, published October 7 in the journalCurrent Biology, showed that not only could two jellies fuse their bodies, but their nervous and digestive systems fused as well. Two effectively became one. “The fusion phenomenon has definitely brought up many interesting questions, such as which genes are involved in fusion, what happens to neural signaling, and what defines ‘self’ and ‘nonself,’” said Jokura, now a postdoctoral researcher at Japan’s National Institute for Basic Biology. “Each of these themes has the potential to challenge our fundamental understanding of biology.” Comb jelliesare found all around the world in coastal waters and the deep ocean. Though they look similar to jellyfish, they don’t sting and belong to a different phylum,Ctenophora, which is Greek for “comb-bearers.” They are named for their combs, rows of hairlike appendages called cilia they use to move through the water. Related articleSurprising jellyfish finding challenges what’s known about learning and memory Ctenophores are one of, if not the, oldest animals on Earth — quite possibly asister to all other animals in the tree of life, so “they provide a really unique opportunity to study fundamental aspects of nervous system function,” said Rodriguez-Santiago, coauthor of the study. “They belong to a group of animals which were there when the very first animals evolved,” said Pawel Burkhardt, an evolutionary biologist and researcher at the University of Bergen in Norway. Burkhardt was coauthor of another October report on M. leidyi, published in the journalPNAS, showing that the jelly is able to develop backward, reverting to an earlier life stage following stress. He was not involved in the study that appeared in Current Biology. “The two recent papers highlight that ctenophores have the opportunity to adapt quickly to changing environments and that their developmental programs are potentially more flexible than seen in other animals,” he said. It also may be, Jokura’s paper suggests, that ctenophores lack the protective allorecognition mechanism that allows one organism to tell the difference between its own cells and tissues and those of another organism. In humans, for example, allorecognition underpins the organ rejection that happens in transplant surgeries. Jokura was studying how M. leidyi responds to light when he discovered two injured specimens had become conjoined. Curious to recreate the phenomenon, he and Rodriguez-Santiago began experimenting. They sliced off parts of several jellies and placed excised pairs together in petri dishes overnight. Nine out of 10 pairs fused successfully, resulting in animals with two sensory organs and two sets of anal openings, whereas typical jellies have only one of each. As it turned out, the fusion happened much more quickly than the researchers expected, according to Jokura. “To observe the fusion process — when and how it happens — we performed time-lapse imaging,” he said. The research team placed cut jellies near each other and waited. At first, the jellies continued to contract their muscles independently. Within an hour, their rhythmic movements started to synchronize. By the two-hour mark, they were in sync. When poked gently on one side, both sides of the combined organism contracted in unison. Imaging demonstrated another layer to the fusion: The animals’ digestive systems also combined. The researchers fed a fluorescently labeled brine shrimp into one mouth of a pair of jellies that had been fused for two days. Then the team traced the meal’s movement through a microscope. The digested particles traveled down the digestive canal, crossed the fusion boundary and entered into the digestive tract of the other animal — “and the other individual could poop out the food,” Rodriguez-Santiago explained. Eventually, the waste was expelled by both anuses, each in its own time. What Rodriguez-Santiago finds most interesting about the study is the way it calls into question what she thought of as “pretty hard boundaries” between self and other. Allorecognition is considered a protective adaptation because it enables a body to reject foreign cells that could introduce dangerous diseases. But these animals “bypass that sensory rejection to then potentially have an even better chance of survival,” she said. Burkhardt believes the findings may lead scientists toward an understanding of when animals evolved allorecognition and how simple nervous systems form and process information. Related articleDeep-sea expedition captures stunning images of creatures in Pacific mining zone Jokura wants to study further how the jellies’ nervous systems mesh following fusion. “I would like to investigate how their ‘thoughts’ are integrated,” he said. “By visualizing neural networks, we might be able to explore something like the fusion of consciousness.” Amanda Schupak is a science and health journalist in New York City.",Science
Human composting is rising in popularity as an earth-friendly life after death,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/climate/human-composting/,"The first time Laura Muckenhoupt felt a glimmer of hope after the death of her 22-year-old son Miles was the drive home from the Washington state facility that had turned his bodyinto hundreds of pounds of soil. There was an empty seat in the family pickup truck where Miles should have been sitting. But riding with her husband and daughter on the 12-hour drive home, Laura felt her son’s presence clearly. “We’re going to grow him,” she remembered thinking. “We’re going to grow him, and we’re going to continue to be his parents and his sister and his friends.” Human composting turns bodies into soil by speeding up “what happens on the forest floor,” according to Tom Harries, CEO ofEarth Funeral, the human composting company the Muckenhoupt family worked with. “What we’re doing is accelerating a completely natural process,” Harris told CNN. Human composting is emerging as an end-of-life alternative that is friendlier to the climate and the Earth — it is far less carbon-intensive than cremation and doesn’t use chemicals involved to preserve bodies in traditional burials. In a haze of grief in the immediate aftermath of his death, the knowledge that her son’s soil represented a new beginning brought Muckenhoupt some measure of comfort. And in the years since, Miles’ soil has traveled and been planted as far as Indonesia and Tuscany, used to help grow passionfruit trees in Portugal and ferns in Hawaii. It’s fitting for Miles, a dancer who thrived in the outdoors. At Muckenhoupt’s home, Miles’ soil was used to plant a rosebush in the garden. And much of the soil resides in a planter in the backyard, next to her son’s favorite hammock chair. “Every time that rose bush blooms, you watch it with such anticipation,” Muckenhoupt said. “It’s such a gift, and it seems like a small visit from him, and it’s gorgeous.” Composting your loved one’s remains feels different than cremation or burial, Muckenhoupt said. “You have had your ceremony, and then the story ends,” she said. “With soil, the story is just beginning.” Harries spent years working in the funeral industry but began rethinking it by contemplating his own mortality. “One of the things that I really realized was I didn’t resonate personally with the existing options. I didn’t want to be buried and didn’t want to be cremated,” Harries said. The rise of cremation has “been the absolute biggest trend in the funeral space” over the past few decades, Harries said, given it is less expensive and more convenient than traditional burial services. About 60% of people who die in the US are cremated, according to the Cremation Association of North America. But cremation pollutes the climate, using predominantly natural gas to power the furnaces that burn the bodies. And traditional burial uses chemicals including formaldehyde and other chemicals used in embalming fluid. Human composting takes surprisingly little to complete. A body is wrapped in a biodegradable shroud and placed in a long metal capsule — surrounded with a mixture of wood chips, mulch and wildflowers. As it decomposes, the body releases nitrogen and the added natural materials provide carbon. With the cask kept at an optimal temperature, it creates perfect conditions for microbes to break the body down at a molecular level. At the end of 45 days, the cask is left with about 300 pounds of nutrient-rich soil, Harries said. Families can choose to take home as much or as little as they want, and Earth Funeral sends any remaining soil to conservation projects in Washington and California. The practice is becoming more popular; it has been legalized in 12 states with bills pending in eight others. Harries said Earth Funeral customers who are doing end of life planning for themselves or a loved one care about the Earth and the climate, or those who are passionate about the outdoors. “This is their final act on Earth,” Harries said. “They’re thinking about kids and future generations.” Kimberly Cooley-Reyes, 66, falls into that category. An avid gardener, Cooley-Rees found human composting after her best friend passed away several years ago and had a green burial. Doing her own end-of-life planning with human composting has given her a sense of peace. “This is something that moves me,” Cooley-Reyes told CNN. “I am going back into the earth, and I will go back cleanly. I’m not going to cause pollution.” Cooley-Reyes lives in San Francisco with her husband, in a home they’ve shared for almost 19 years not far from the beach. When she looks of out her bedroom window, she can see all the way to the Farallon Islands. Immediately below her bedroom window is the beloved garden she will one day amend as soil. “It makes me feel immortal, quite frankly,” she said. “This is the only home I’ve ever owned; it’s the happiest place I’ve ever lived, so for me to be able to stay here is pretty special.”",Science
2 Oregon men die from exposure in a forest after they went out to look for Sasquatch,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/us/washington-forest-death-sasquatch/,"Two Oregon men were found dead in a Washington state forest after they failed to return from a trip to look for Sasquatch, authorities said Saturday. The 59-year-old and 37-year-old appear to have died from exposure, the Skamania County Sheriff’s Office said via Facebook. The weather and the men’s lack of preparedness led the office to draw that conclusion, it said. Sasquatch is a folkloric beast thought by some to roam the forests, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The two men were found in a heavily wooded area of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, which is about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northeast of Portland. A family member reported them missing at around 1 a.m. on Christmas Day after they failed to return from a Christmas Eve outing. Sixty volunteer search-and-rescue personnel helped in the three-day search, including canine, drone and ground teams. The Coast Guard used infrared technology to search from the air. Authorities used camera recordings to locate the vehicle used by the pair off Oklahoma Road near Willard, which is on the southern border of the national forest.",Society
"Man accused of attacking TV reporter, saying ‘This is Trump’s America now’",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/28/us/patrick-thomas-egan-accused-tv-reporter-attack/,"A Colorado man is facing possible bias-motivated charges for allegedly attacking a television news reporter after demanding to know whether he was a citizen, saying “This is Trump’s America now,” according to court documents. Patrick Thomas Egan, 39, was arrested December 18 in Grand Junction after police say he followed KKCO/KJCT reporter Ja’Ronn Alex’s vehicle for around 40 miles from the Delta area. Alex told police that he believed he had been followed and attacked because he is Pacific Islander. After arriving in Grand Junction, Egan, who was driving a taxi, pulled up next to Alex at a stoplight and, according to an arrest affidavit, said something to the effect of: “Are you even a US citizen? This is Trump’s America now! I’m a Marine and I took an oath to protect this country from people like you!” Alex, who had been out reporting, then drove back to his news station in the city. After he got out of his vehicle, Egan chased Alex as he ran toward the station’s door and demanded to see his identification, according to the document laying out police’s evidence in the case. Egan then tackled Alex, put him in a headlock and “began to strangle him,” the affidavit said. Coworkers who ran out to help and witnesses told police that Alex appeared to be losing his ability to breathe during the attack, which was partially captured on surveillance video, according to the document. According to the station’s website, Alex is a native of Detroit. KKCO/KJCT reported that he was driving a news vehicle at the time. Egan was arrested on suspicion of bias-motivated crimes, second degree assault and harassment. He is scheduled to appear in court Thursday to learn whether prosecutors have filed formal charges against him. Egan’s lawyer, Ruth Swift, was out of the office Friday and did not return a telephone message seeking comment. KKCO/KJCT vice president and general manager Stacey Stewart said the station could not comment beyondwhat it has reported on the attack.","Society, Politics"
Meet the husband-wife legal team representing ‘Diddy’ and Mangione,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/28/us/karen-friedman-agnifilo-marc-attorneys/,"The rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs and the suspected health care CEO assassin Luigi Mangione have decided on a similar defense strategy: Hire an Agnifilo. Or two. Marc Agnifilo is heading Combs’ defense againstracketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges, while Karen Friedman Agnifilo is leadingMangione’s murder defense, with Marc in a support role. For much of the past few decades, the legal power couple often found themselves on opposite sides of such complex cases – she for the prosecution, and he for the defense. Now, they find themselves representing two of the most high-profile cases in the country today. From 2014 to 2021, Karen was the second-in-command in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, which brought notable cases against defendants includingHarvey WeinsteinandAllen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. She left the department in 2021 and has since moved into media, with a stint as a CNN legal analyst and contributor. Marc, meanwhile, has represented many of the targets of those DA investigations, including “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli,Nxivm founder Keith Raniereandformer Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng. He worked for the law firm Brafman & Associates from 2006 until earlier this year, when he split off to co-found the firmAgnifilo Intrater. Parents to three adult children, the law is what brought them together. The two met at the Manhattan DA’s office in 1992 while working on a case in which two bagel store deliverymen got into an argument, and one cut off the other’s arm with a machete, according toThe New York Times. Their intersecting careers have at times led to legal conflicts of interest. In 2011, Karen had to recuse herself from the Manhattan DA’s case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn when the former head of the International Monetary Fund hired the law firm where Marc worked. “It’s never been awkward,” Marc toldThe New York Timesin 2011. “We’re pretty regimented about it. If she’s recused from a case, we really don’t talk about it.” The Agnifilos declined a CNN request for an interview. But that was then, and now, the Agnifilos have joined forces. Monday, when Mangione appeared in a New York courthouse for his arraignment, Karen was positioned to his left, and Marc sat on his right. Karen spoke to the court and criticized what she called the NYPD’s over-the-top“perp walk”of her client, drawing on her years of service for perspective. “He was on display for everyone to see in the biggest staged perp walk I’ve ever seen in my career,” she said. Karen Friedman Agnifilo has decades of experience in the legal field, primarily in the Manhattan DA’s Office. She most recently served as the chief assistant district attorney under then-District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. until 2021. Herprofessional bionotes her “critical leadership role in prosecuting high-profile violent crime cases, including complex cases involving a mental health component.” She managed a team of 1,500 people with a $120 million budget and “was also integral to creating the office’s Human Trafficking Unit, Hate Crimes Unit, Antiquities Trafficking Unit, Terrorism Unit, its Cybercrimes and Identity Theft Bureau, as well as working on the creation of Manhattan’s first Mental Health Court,” according to her bio. She left public service in 2021 – complete with abagpipe sendoff from the NYPD and DA’s office– and moved to private practice. In an interview with the “Shut Up Mommy’s Talking” podcast in 2022, Karen said moving into defense work was an adjustment. She cited her husband’s experience in deciding whom to take on as a client. “My husband’s also a criminal defense attorney and he’s had some clients who just aren’t nice to him. And I don’t mean, like just not a little bit nice, I mean like abusive,” she said. “And I don’t want that at this stage in my life.” “There’s no crime necessarily that I wouldn’t take or even set of factors that I wouldn’t take,” she added. “I do believe that everyone’s entitled to a defense and to good representation, and I’ve always believed that.” Karen said she has also been influenced by her children. Her twin daughters took an interest in politics and the Black Lives Matter movement during the Covid-19 pandemic, changing her thinking on the topic. “I have to credit them with opening my eyes to these issues,” she said. Her third child has autism, she told the podcast, and she had frustrating experiences trying to get them help. She then used her experiences as a “special needs mom” to implement systems in the DA’s office to help those with less money or opportunity, she said. “That became sort of my mission at the DA’s office. It was very much into alternatives to incarceration, I pushed that very hard,” she said. Related articleLuigi Mangione, CEO killing suspect, pleads not guilty to state terror and murder charges In recent years, Karen has moved into the media. She has served as thelegal adviserto the long-running show “Law & Order,” worked as aCNN legal analystand opines on legal issues as the podcast host of “Legal AF” and “MissTrial” on the MeidasTouch Network. Her vocal media presence may offer a preview of her defense strategy. Earlier this month on CNN, before taking on Mangione as a client, she offered her thoughts on how the case could proceed. “It looks to me like there might be a not guilty by reason of insanity defense that they’re going to be thinking about because the evidence is going to be so overwhelming that he did what he did,”she said on December 10. “As a former prosecutor in that office, I would be concerned that you have someone who is a valedictorian of his class, he was brilliant his whole life, he comes from this great family. I mean, something changed, significantly, something changed. And they’re going to potentially have a not guilty by reason of insanity potential defense, so the prosecutors are going to try to shore that up as well in their investigation.” Marc Agnifilo similarly began his career in prosecutors’ offices and has since made a mark defending high-profile defendants in complex cases on the state, federal and international levels. A graduate of Connecticut College and Brooklyn Law School, he worked at the US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey and as a Manhattan assistant district attorney before turning to criminal defense,his website states. He has defended some of the most publicly reviled defendants of the past decade in Shkreli and Raniere, both ofwhom were convicted at trial. “You may find him repulsive, disgusting and offensive. We don’t convict people in this country for being repulsive or offensive,” he argued in Raniere’s trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. “Unpopular ideas aren’t criminal. Disgusting ideas aren’t criminal.” In recent months, Marc took on Combs’ case andhas repeatedly asked the courtto release the rapper on bond before trial. Other cases, many of which are listed on his website, have been resolved without charges or with short sentences. He toldLaw.com earlier this yearhis new law firm will focus on complex criminal litigation with an eye toward trying cases. “I have found that people come to me when they have something to say against the government’s allegations,” Marc said. “Very often that means they want to go to trial. So we all plan to do what we’ve always done: to try a bunch of cases. That’s our supreme value.”","Society, Entertainment"
Some inmates seeking education behind bars face a ‘double sentence’,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/28/business/inmates-coding-jobs/,"Graduation day dawns sunny and warm for the first day of November, but the weather hardly matters for the joint MIT-Georgetown coding class, which takes place at the Correctional Treatment Facility, one of the two facilities that make up the DC jail complex. For twelve weeks, the students worked hard, hunched over laptops, squinting at characters and lines of code. Their work culminated in this: websites built from scratch and a certificate acknowledging their participation in college-accredited courses from these prestigious institutions. Today, they join over 200 other students at correctional facilities across the country who have completed the Brave Behind Bars program since the group’s founding in 2021. A graduation celebration looks different behind bars. Yellow and blue frosted cupcakes lined up next to lemonade and iced tea and chicken sandwiches sit waiting while the students proudly pose for photos with Marisa Gaetz, Brave Behind Bar’s co-founder. The food arrived much later than the students but no one seemed to mind; here you get used to waiting — especially for the rare celebratory occasion. Gaetz made the trek down from Massachusetts, taking a break from her PhD work to be here. She said she didn’t want to miss the chance to shake the students’ hands and tell them face to face all the things she enjoyed about working with each one of them. Her slow, precise way of speaking mirrors the painstaking work that these students have done in writing code to power websites. One by one, the students come up, take their certificate and pose for a photo with the people who made this program possible. The photos will have to do as a keepsake of this moment: the students can’t keep the physical copy – a precaution so no one else duplicates the certificate trying to pass it off as their own, an attempt to demonstrate good behavior to a judge without actually taking the class. These certificates will have to go to the students’ lawyers for safekeeping. It’s just one of the many precautions put in place for this course, one of the newest additions to prison and jail education. Here, safety questions always dominate. In a classroom next door, Taylor Swift plays over computer speakers as teams of two hunch over metal boxes and wiring. These students have chosen to learn about another piece of our information economy: repairing telecom equipment. The same tools these students wield to learn this lucrative craft could pose a real danger to their fellow detainees or jail staff outside this classroom. Their teacher, Timothy Saunders, painstakingly checks in and out the tools each class. He proudly tells me they’ve not had any issues on the safety front. Saunders boasts students can employ the skills they learn here to eventually earn six figure jobs. That is, of course, dependent on two things: that they get out, and once they do, that someone will hire them. The class is one of the many available to students in the lower security of DC’s two jail facilities. Administrators and detainees alike are grateful for the opportunities. Studyafterstudyshows incarcerated education helps do what citizens and policymakers alike say they want: keep people from committing more crimes. However, getting education for many people behind bars remains a challenge. Thirty years ago, the 1994 crime bill drastically cut funding for prisoner education. And while lawmakersrestored this money in 2020, across the country the gap between what kind of education prisoners would like and what they can accessremains vast. This is doubly true because many of those behind bars lackeven high school education- to say nothing of college or post-secondary training. The team responsible for education at the DC jail includes Jason McCrady, a former public-school counselor who noticed that so many of his students ended up behind bars that he got hired by the jail system to continue providing what education he could for those students. Technology education efforts got a boost during the pandemic, as visits and in-person services got further curtailed, and jails and prisons incorporated more digital communication tools. In the DC jail, this meant secure tablets. These devices greatly expanded the opportunities those awaiting trial would have for education and communication. At the same time, facilities have put guardrails in place. Communications, much like those over the phone, can be monitored. The functionality is limited. The students in the coding class have even more access to technology but unlike their peers on the outside, they only get limited hours each day on the laptops they use to code and they can only visit a limited number of sites pre-approved by the jail. For Gaetz, and her students, jumping through the hoops is worth it. The United States, put plainly, locks up a lot of people. But the people behind bars aren’t evenly distributed across society. This means that many people in the United States don’t have a personal connection to a system thatdetainsandmonitorsnearly five million people, according to the latest statistics from the Department of Justice. This lack of connection, activists say, is one of the stumbling blocks to reform. For Gaetz, her connection to the correction system began in 2016. Her undergrad philosophy professor, Lee Perlman, taught a course at a local prison and so Gaetz tagged along. “Within minutes of sitting in that class my perception of incarcerated people was transformed,” she recalls. “Someone in that class told me that before he had taken classes while incarcerated no one had believed in him. And this one time a week not only is he treated like a human being but a student and someone whose opinion matters.” She immediately understood the power of education in an entirely different paradigm than her own. “MIT has some of the smartest students in the world,” she says “we all kind of feel like we’d do well and here I was with these students who had never had the encouragement that many of us take for granted.” She signed up to assist in that philosophy class. The years went on, she finished up her undergrad degree in math and philosophy and started a PhD program in theoretical math. She’d dabbled in computer science courses and taught herself to code as a kind of hobby. When the pandemic struck, and jails and prisons began experimenting with more connectivity, Gaetz - along with Emily Harberg and Martin Nisser - launched acodingboot campin 2021, first starting with women’s correctional facilities in New England. The program is straightforward. The trio aided by an ever-expanding group of expert mentors teach the students the basics of how to write code, with a bespoke website serving as their final project. But as with any education, along the way, the students pick up additional skills. Coding requires patience and confidence, but also collaboration. “A lot of people on Day One are honest and say they don’t think they can do it,” Gaetz says. ”Seeing that they’re able to do it can be really empowering.” Gaetz understands that some might feel uneasy about teaching even basic coding to people who’ve committed or are accused of committing crimes. But she maintains students graduate with the ability only to build a website, not hack or commit other cybercrimes. Although there are already rumblings of AI taking away coding jobs, Gaetz says today AI gets used mostly to assist in coding while most software engineering jobs still require an actual person. Besides, some of the students who come to class have little experience with computers, so the course builds literacy, confidence and problem-solving skills alongside the basic coding. All skills that most employers expect their new hires to have. Which leads to the next obvious question: Can these students use these skills to earn a living? In the DC classroom, the students put together websites speaking to their passions or interests. Their topics varied: One student with scotch tape holding his glasses together, created a site to explain the high sociological toll of poverty. Another made a site as a tribute to the positive power of music. The class’s sole female student, Iesha Marks, who goes by Tazz, built a website to help women, like her, who suffer domestic violence. Like so many behind bars, Tazz’s story contains elements of trauma. Her defense team wrote in court documents of her PTSD from a stabbing. And she, in turn, stands accused of causing grave harm. In 2021 she pleaded guilty to attempted assault with a gun. And though she’s professed her innocence, she’s been held on charges of that she shot and killed a man, Donald Childs, on a busy DC street in July of 2023 an offense to which she has pleaded not guilty. Her defense holds up her good record during the year plus of her detention, including her participation in the coding class, as evidence she’s demonstrating stability and should be released with supervision so she can care for her children ahead of the trial. A judge disagreed and ordered her held until her trial date, May of 2026. In between bites of her lunch, Tazz recalled that at the beginning, she wasn’t sure she could tackle this topic. Now scrolling through her site, full of resources for other survivors, she lights up with the possibility: maybe she created space for other women to find help and hope. It’s not just Tazz in DC. Gaetz explains that some of their earliest successes involved working with women behind bars. Some of the coding program’s first students were female inmates in New England. Some of the alumni from this group created and maintain a site calledReentry Sistersdevoted to helping women in Maine rebuild their lives when they return to society from long prison stints. The well-designed site has hopeful stories and helpful tips. It also serves as a reminder of the perilous period that awaits even the most diligent student of this program. Steve Johnson, an early graduate of the program, recalls that fear well. Released from prison during 2021 he remembers the fear when his parole officer demanded he get work within two weeks. With a conviction for armed robbery, despite time served, he struggled to land a job. He turned to the internet, searching for someone who could help him find a job or get the education he’d need for this new economy. The search yielded a familiar name: Lee Perlman, Gaetz’s undergraduate professor. “I cold called him,” Johnson recalled and within a day they’d connected, made a plan and got Johnson into the coding program. Johnson loved Brave Behind Bars so much he stayed on after graduation as a teaching assistant. “That role has been very helpful being on the other end, when you’re teaching something to someone you have to know it inside out,” he says. “The thing that I like the most is being able to help someone who is not very proficient and making their life easier by integrating some sort of tech-based solution for them.” Johnson’s story, by many measures, represents a best-case scenario. In the years since his release he learned a top digital skill, is teaching others, and has done numerous contract coding jobs. He loves it because although it’s hard and coding “has given me gray hair”  you can work “anywhere with Wi-Fi.” His experience has also led to an appointment on a board that advises governments on how to think about education behind bars - something he evangelizes and deeply hopes to improve. Put simply: Johnson loves finding a problem and working to identify solutions. Yet even with this experience, Johnson worries that his past still holds him back. His jobs have all thus far been with organizations interested in rehabilitation and prison reform. He wonders if they hire him to get some kind of credibility in the space. He longs to be judged, for good or for ill, for his current skill not his criminal record. So now he’s trying for yet another reinvention, a 17-week tech incubator program with Defy Ventures, an organization that teaches formerly incarcerated people business chops. He figures if he can’t convince the boss of his bonafides, maybe he could become the boss himself. Then he could hire whomever he wanted based on what they bring to the job today and not get hung up on anyone’s past. This is what some refer to as a double sentence: the steep hill people returning from prison have to face in order to get jobs or rent apartments. Once you’ve done the time, how do you convince people they can trust you? For Johnson the question is a pragmatic one. “Do you want your neighbor to re-offend?” he muses. The data on this point is clear: better education and job opportunities make that prospect less likely. And here again, Johnson has adeptly identified the problem, but unlike writing a code, this problem lacks a tidy solution. Changing minds takes more time and patience even than fixing buggy code.","Business, Society"
Costco is pushing back — hard — against the anti-DEI movement,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/27/business/costco-dei/,"Costco is battling an anti-DEI wave with a stern rebuke to activist shareholders looking to end the warehouse retailer’s diversity ambitions. Walmart, John Deere, Tractor Supply and other companies arechanging or walking awayfrom diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. But Costco believes DEI helps its “treasure hunt” shopping atmosphere, and it is standing behind its efforts. Costco’s board of directors unanimously recommended that its shareholdersvote againsta proposal brought by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research, that would require Costco to evaluate and issue a report on the financial risks of maintaining its diversity and inclusion goals. The group criticized Costco for possible “illegal discrimination” against employees who are “white, Asian, male or straight.” The National Center for Public Policy Research did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Costco has a chief diversity officer and a supplier program that focuses on expanding with small and diverse businesses. It also donates to organizations like the Thurgood Marshall College Fund that serve minorities and underrepresented groups. Costco said its DEI efforts help the company attract and retain a wide range of employees and improve merchandise and services in stores. Costco also said its members want to interact with a diverse employee base. “Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the ‘treasure hunt’ that our customers value,” Costco said in its proxystatementto investors. “We believe (and member feedback shows) that many of our members like to see themselves reflected in the people in our warehouses with whom they interact.” The board went further in its recommendation to vote against the proposal, saying the think tank is masking its true anti-diversity agenda under the guise of reducing risk. Costco said the NCPPR is inflicting burdens on companies with challenges to DEI and the organization’s broader agenda is to abolish diversity initiatives. “The proponent professes concern about legal and financial risks to the company and its shareholders associated with the diversity initiatives,” the company said. “The supporting statement demonstrates that it is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs. The proponent’s broader agenda is not reducing risk for the company but abolition of diversity initiatives.” Costco released its proxy earlier this month, but the statementgained attentiononsocial mediathis week. There’s no single definition of DEI, but it’s generally a mix of employee training, employee resource networks and recruiting practices to advance representation of people of different races, genders and classes, people with disabilities, veterans and others. The shareholder resolution contends that Costco’s DEI practices are potentially discriminatory. But Costco said its policies are legal and non-discriminatory. Costco, which pays some of the highest wages in retail and is considered a progressive employer, is backing DEI at a moment when such initiatives areunder attackfrom right-wing activists, legal groups, conservative customers and President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Most companies are not abandoning DEI entirely, but some are modifying terminology from “DEI” to “inclusion” or “belonging” in an attempt to fend off pressure. Companies are also advertising their efforts less prominently than they were in 2020 and 2021.",Business
Christmas dinner injury forces golf’s World No. 1 to miss PGA Tour season opener,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/27/sport/scottie-scheffler-injury-christmas-dinner-spt/,"WhileChristmasDay is the most wonderful time of the year for many, Scottie Scheffler will remember his2024festivities for different reasons. To cap off a roller coasteryear for the men’s golf World No. 1, Scheffler suffered an injury while preparing his Christmas dinner and will now miss the start of the PGA Tour’s 2025season. “On Christmas Day while preparing dinner, Scottie sustained a puncture wound to the palm of his right hand from a broken glass,” Scheffler’s manager Blake Smith said via the PGA Tour on Friday. “Small glass fragments remained in the palm which required surgery.” Smith added that Scheffler has been told he “should be back to 100% in three to four weeks”. But following surgery, the 28-year-old will miss The Sentry tournament, the PGA Tour season-opener in Hawaii. This news is just the latest in a hectic calendar year for Scheffler – on and off the golf course. On the links, Scheffler has been on a streak that most golfers can only dream of. In April, he won the Masters before going on to win gold at this year’s Olympic Games in Paris. In total, Scheffler won seven events on the PGA Tour in 2024, including the TOUR Championship. Scheffler also won the Hero World Challenge and helped lead Team USA to its tenth straight win at the Presidents Cup. It was an equally memorable year off the course for the Olympic Gold medalist. Scheffler and his wife Meredith welcomed their first child on May 8 this year, just over a week before Scheffler played in the PGA Championship. It was during that tournament that Scheffler wasarrested, charged with felony assault and released from jail before shooting a stellar 5-under par on day two of the event. All charges against the golfer werelater dismissed. Scheffler will be hard-pressed to ever have a more eventful year than he had in 2024, and his 2025 season will now be getting off to a much quieter start after his injury. Scheffler expects to return to competition in mid-January at The American Express tournament at La Quinta, California, according to Smith.",Sports
"Why Nefertiti still inspires, 3,300 years after she reigned",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/26/style/nefertiti-beauty-inspiration-style/,"One hundred years ago, in a courtyard at the Neues Museum in Berlin, the world came face to face for the first time with one of its most enduring beauty icons: Queen Nefertiti. Discovered in Egypt in 1912 by German archaeologists, her 3,300-year-old stucco-coated limestone bust went on display in 1924. Its unveiling stunned audiences from Cairo to London and sparked a century-long fascination with her aesthetic. The artifact’s sharply defined features — her chiseled jawline, high cheekbones, ‘swan-like’ neck, and kohl-rimmed eyes — have, for decades, served as a reference point across fashion and the arts. In the bust, Nefertiti is seen wearing a wide collar and a flat-topped crown with a golden band and uraeus (a headdress featuring a sacred serpent), decorated in greens, yellows, browns and blues. Research indicates that she was a royal and noblewoman who reportedly bore six daughters, one of whom is said to have married Tutankhamun, but little else is known about Nefertiti’s life and origins. Egypt in the 14th century BC was not ethnically or racially homogeneous, and many scholars surmise that, based on her depictions and the region’s population, Nefertiti would be considered a woman of color in today’s terms. “Nefertiti’s bust is so perfect; she’s so self-possessed,” Dr. Cheryl Finley, a professor of art history at Spelman College in Atlanta, told CNN.“That’s what really grabs the attention and imagination. It’s her confidence, and her gaze, of course. It’s something that attracts us all.” Following the bust’s discovery in the 1920s, Nefertiti quickly became an “it” girl. The meaning of her name, ‘the beautiful one has arrived,’ proved particularly apt, as her face was plastered across advertisements for kohl, and her likeness appeared in beauty columns. Related articleWhy pop culture’s love of Joan of Arc endures Designers of the time, such as the French couturier Paul Poiret, incorporated Egyptian motifs into their work. In 1945, American milliner Lilly Daché designed hats with a distinct Nefertiti flair. By 1961, Vogue had published an article exploring the world’s ongoing “fascination” with the queen. Elizabeth Taylor’s portrayal of Cleopatra in 1963 further cemented this obsession, making the “Egyptian look” a staple in fashion circles. Nefertiti’s style continued to influence fashion decades after the bust’s discovery. In Dior’s Spring 2004 show, John Galliano showcased looks that included tall Nefertiti hats. In 2015, Christian Louboutin launched a lipstick collection that drew inspiration from the royal wife, featuring gold-and-black vials adorned with crowns. (Nefertiti likely used the natural clay earth pigment red ochre for her lips). Jewelry designers like Azza Fahmy have evoked her in their pieces, while Azzedine Alaïa’s Fall 2017 line paid tribute with black turbans, one of which was famously worn by supermodel Naomi Campbell. In the modern day, Nefertiti’s significance as a cultural icon remains strong. On TikTok and Instagram, influencers recreate the queen’s looks in tutorials. Her likeness inspires items as varied as mass-produced T-shirts and mugs to$14,000 dressesand high-end perfumes. In the beauty industry, Black and brown-owned brands like Juvia’s Place and UOMA Beauty have marketed makeup that pays homage to Nefertiti. Even plastic surgeons name-drop her with the “Nefertiti Lift”— a non-invasive cosmetic technique that uses Botox to enhance the jawline. “Nefertiti’s bust… transcends time,” explained Finley. “It also enables people to draw their own power from it.” But the story of how the bust of Nefertiti found its way to Berlin in the first place is mired in controversy. After being transported to Europe in 1913, one year after its discovery in Egypt, the piece was hidden from public view for over a decade. In 1924, to much fanfare, it was put on display at the Neues Museum, where it still remains, spurring an ongoing debate about its rightful resting place (arecent petitionled by Egyptologist Zahi Hawass has reignited calls for its repatriation, saying that its removal from the country was “unjustified” and against “the spirit of Egyptian laws”.) Related articleDress Codes: How the pussy-bow blouse became a political staple for Kamala Harris and other powerful women When the bust was first unveiled, White Western women sought to emulate Nefertiti’s look. A 1933 New York Timesarticle encouraged women to recreate her angular features — albeit without darkening the skin, echoing structural imbalances in the beauty industry, which fetishized non-European aesthetics yet discouraged and discriminated against darker skin tones. Women began to fashion their looks after Nefertiti’s style, lining their eyes like her cat-eye, wearing tops that imitated the era’s collars, and donning tall hats or styling their hair high to resemble her crown. Replicas of the bust even appeared in American hair salons, promising the allure of her ‘exotic’ beauty. “And why wouldn’t you want to look like her?” said Dr. Elka Stevens, an associate professor of visual culture and studio art at Howard University in Washington, D.C. “Take the crown off, drop her in any society, and she can fit in. ” Nefertiti may have been more palatable to European audiences as some of the bust’s features align well with Western aesthetic preferences, explained Professor Charmaine A. Nelson of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The queen, she noted, defied “so much of the history of the Western perception of Black women and women of color, (which) is as ‘other,’ as ‘grotesque,’ as ‘unaesthetic body,’” said Nelson, who teaches Black diasporic art and art history. “It’s really striking and probably works in the favor of the White gaze that her hair is covered,” she added, suggesting that textured hair, particularly Afro-textured styles, have historically challenged Eurocentric beauty standards. In some ways, Nefertiti tells us more about ourselves than she does about her. Although she is one of ancient history’s most recognizable figures, much of her life remains a mystery — a gap that allows her persona to be molded into whatever icon society needs at any given time. As the wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten, Nefertiti played a major role in Egyptian politics. Together, the pair led a religious revolution by abandoning polytheism and promoting worship of the sun god Aten. Nefertiti was often portrayed with her husband in elaborate attire, suggesting her fashion was tied to her political grativas. But12 yearsinto Akhenaten’s reign, she vanished from historical records, leading to endless theories about her fate — was she forced into exile, did she fall ill, or was she murdered? Some speculate that she may have even assumed a new identity as aco-regent. Nefertiti’s legacy has been whitewashed in various ways; a 2018 3D reconstruction, for example, sparked backlash for its lighter skin tone. Such efforts reflect attempts to whiten Egypt and to “make claim to it as closer to Europe than to (Black) Africa,” Nelson notes. Meanwhile, in Black culture, Nefertiti has been embraced as a symbol of power, with contemporary figures like Beyoncé and Rihanna drawing from her image. Rihanna, who has a tattoo of Nefertiti’s bust on her ribcage, paid homage to her in a2017 Vogue Arabia cover.Beyoncé channeled Nefertiti in her 2016 “Sorry” music video, styling her hair to mimic the crown and posing like the artwork. The singer’s Coachella performance in 2018 featured a Balmain-designed cape adorned with Nefertiti’s resemblance. At the height of her career, Erykah Badu wrapped her locs in the shape of the queen’s headdress; Aretha Franklin also wore “Nefertiti head wraps”. More recently, English singer FKA Twigs flaunted a half-shaved head and faux locs, mirroring Nefertiti’s crown and, at the 2024 Met Gala, Imaan Hammam’s makeup artist gave the Dutch supermodel exaggerated eyeliner, also honoring the ancient queen. The royal consort’s memory goes far beyond trends — it helps shape how people see themselves, said Stevens. “It changes the way we engage with one another when we know there’s this shared history.” Perhaps most important is that for many, Nefertiti’s image is deeply personal. “I see my family when I look at her, and I can see your family,” says Stevens. For this reason, “we’re going to be regaled with tales of her beauty until the end of time. She’s not going anywhere — she’s going to live through each of us, and that’s the most exciting thing.”","Entertainment, World"
