TheTexas Department of Public Safetysaid that its troopers had recovered the two little girls, who are five and nine years old, after the smuggler had abandoned them and fled back to Mexico.

However, Vance's skillful showings in combative interviews soon earned him a reputation as one of Trump's best surrogates, and he was also widely considered the winner of the only vice-presidential debate with Democratic counterpart Tim Walz. Less than three years ago, Vance was part of a crowded field of contenders for the Ohio Republican Senate nomination. He went on to win the primary, defeat Democrat Tim Ryan and then join Trump's successful White House ticket in one of the quickest rises in political history. Vance, 40, will be the third-youngest vice president in American history when he is sworn in next month.

Garfitt/Invision/AP, File) Swift has had her fair share of malfunctions during the nearly two-year run of The Eras Tour, most recently having to think quickly on her feet when part ofher stage stopped workingas she began singing \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" from her most recent album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" When performing the song, Swift steps onto a platform, dubbed the Tayroomba, which begins to move in the rhythm of the song and mirrors its lyrics. It usually starts off by propelling her from one end of the stage to the other, but it quickly became clear it was not working that night, as Swift slid off and began walking across the stage. The singer took the malfunction and turned it into an iconic moment, as she went on to recreate the movements the platform was supposed to make in her dance moves.

In a video obtained by Fox News Digital, the \"Last Night\" singer can be seen walking towards the edge of the stage. A concert-goer decided to throw a pair of blue underweardirectly at Wallen's face. The underwear landed and was stuck on the brim of Wallen's hat before it fell directly onto the singer's hands. The country singer, who was performing his hit song \"I Had Some Help\" with rapper Post Malone, took no time to process the unique gift thrown on stage, immediately continuing on to sing the song's chorus. As he got into it, he threw the blue underwear back into the crowd.

Before we get going, I just want to check to make sure. Luke, you're moving OK. You looked all right at the open of the show there. . . . Are you damaged in any way?\" Seacrest said. Bryan quipped, \"What are you talking about Ryan?\" He later added the fall had not been choreographed and was just \"good old-fashioned foolishness,\" also adding that it \"was actually the best moment of the night.\" Rucker almost fell on his face when he stumbled over a monitor while performing in South Carolina.(Photo by C Brandon/Redferns) Darius Rucker had quite the scare when he almost fell flat on his face while performing with his band, Hootie & the Blowfish, in October, during the annual Riverfront Revival in Charleston, South Carolina, which he organizes each year.

In a fan-recorded video, Bryan can be seen walking across the stage to pick the object off the stage, then walking over to a standing microphone to begin scanning the crowd for who had thrown the object. \"Who threw this?\" he asked. \"Who was it? Does anybody know?\" he continued. \"Who we pointing at?

        "content": "A CNN guest told anchor Dana Bash that young men's concerns are about practical issues and fears about an upcoming war, not the cultural issues that DC elites discuss. It’s no big secret that the cost of attending afour-year collegeor university in the United States is out of control. It’s almost gravity defying how the cost of college has increased relative to regular inflation over the past twenty years. In fact, more than 500 nonprofit private colleges have shut down in the last decade according to the Wall Street Journal, which was \"three times what it was in the decade prior.\" The news is about to get worse, and there is a stern warning announcement coming from the pilot in the cockpit. 2025 is going to have a lot of turbulence followed by potentially weekly plane crashes of colleges and universities who can no longer afford to open their doors. This new reality is the ultimate law of supply and demand and families in America are voting with their feet. LOW ENROLLMENT AND FINANCIAL STRUGGLES FORCE A NY COLLEGE TO CLOSE: ‘IT’S REALLY UNFAIR TO EVERYONE' WHY ARE COLLEGES CLOSING AT SUCH A RAPID RATE? Enrollment Trend experts have new terminology they call the \"enrollment cliff.\" The number of students enrolled in degree-grantingcolleges and universitiesfell by 15% from 2010 to 2021 and only 62% of high school seniors in the U.S. immediately go on to college right now. That’s a stark contrast to almost fifteen years ago when the number was 68% in 2010, according to government data. Many of the students who opt out of a postsecondary education are low-income students, but even those with means are beginning to choose alternatives. We’ve also seen a spike in the competition for state colleges and universities where parents can enjoy in-state tuition and other possible grant programs offered for only in-state students. Beyond the fact that some students are taking certification courses versus going to college, some are entering the workplace and some are considering alternative career paths, we are experiencing a record low number of new babies in the United States which will have a long-term impact on the shrinking enrollment for colleges and universities. This trend of low birth rates began roughly 17 years ago. After hitting an all-time high in 2007, the Great Recession hit in 2008 causing fertility rates to plummet.  The national birth rate fell 23% between 2007 and 2022, and fast-forward to the present day, it isn’t apparent that generation Z twenty-somethings are itching to get a family going. This decline in theoverall birth rateis why beginning next year in 2025, and lasting until 2037, we are going to see a major decline in enrollment as 2008 babies begin to reach college age. It’s not the money… It’s the money Thirty plus years of providing financial advice for families across America and the number one complaint in the planning process isn’t about how much money someone is going to need to retire. The dialogue quickly shifts to how it’s going to be possible to put two, three, or even four kids through afour-year college education. Colleges and universities are starting to feel the financial pain. Even though these higher institutions don’t pay federal income tax or pay real estate taxes, the higher overall operating costs of having a five-star operation and state-imposed restrictions on tuition increases for public colleges have limited colleges and universities' ability to increase tuition revenue. Couple that with the overall market where families are voting with their feet to attend lower-cost colleges and universities, it has put a heavy strain on the ability of these institutions to remain fiscally solvent. While there are more than 150 colleges and universities boasting more than $1 billion dollars in endowment money, there’s a slew of others that are battling for enrollment, fighting for keeping academic talent and pondering how to keep facilities at a level that new college students have grown to expect from a school. This not only can affect theschoolitself, but the surrounding towns or cities where local business is built around the school. On average, each college or university that shuts down affects 265 jobs and $14 million dollars of labor income. To keep their head above water, some colleges have cut faculty and slashed areas of academic study, but it won’t be enough to face the Titanic-like cold water that many universities and colleges are about to face. Alternative Career Paths Under DOGE we may eventually see theDepartment of Educationeliminated.  And with the possibility of Pete Hegseth becoming the new Secretary of Defense, we may see a new pitch to young people about joining the United States military. We don’t yet what the future of education will look like in the United States, but it’s quite possible that teenagers in high school will have four potential career paths in the future. 1. College or university 2. Vocational school 3. Entrepreneurship 4. Military CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It’s now harder to find blue-collar workers than white-collar workers, reversing a decades-long trend in the U.S. job market. Take plumbers as an example. It’s expected by 2027 that the United States will be short some 550,000 plumbers, which is bad news for the cost to get plumbing fixed and the time it will take to find someone to fix it. These kinds of statistics are universal across all lines of home services blue collar workers. There are great careers in the military as well and military enlistment has been steadily down over the past 40 years. At the end of the 2023 fiscal year (September 2023), three branches reported falling short of their recruitment goals: the Navy was at 80% of its target number, the Army was at 77% and the Air Force was at 89%. The Marine Corps and Space Force were the only branches to meet their recruitment goals. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The total number of active-duty service members in the US armed forces declined roughly 6% from 2012 to 2022, from 1.4 million to 1.3 million. We are going to need more young people to join the military over the next 10 years. Closures are coming The cost of tuition and fees plus room and board for a four-year private college averaged $58,600 in the 2024-2025 school year. With inflation, that’s roughly $250,000 to get one child through a four-year college education. If parents and students continue to question the hefty price tag of a college education, we could see enrollment fall to record lows over the next decade and more colleges close their doors and shut down their operations. Class is not in session!

Russian PresidentVladimir Putin seemingly took a page out of President Biden’s book and is offering to write off debts for new recruits enlisting in the country’s military for one year. In November, Putin signed a law allowing anyone who joined the Russian military after Dec. 1, 2024, to have debs of up to 10 million rubles, or about $96,000, written off. The Associated Press reported that the law applies to debts in which a court order for collection was issued, and enforcement proceedings had commenced before Dec. 1, 2024. The legislation also applies to spouses of new recruits. The move appears to be similar to one from Biden’s own playbook, though the latter does not connect loan handouts to military recruitment.

The massive handout will give 54,900 public workers loan forgiveness but also brings the total loan forgiveness approved by Biden to nearly $180 billion for nearly 5 million borrowers. The Biden-Harris administration touted the program for creating an \"incentive\" for public servants to \"pursue and remain\" in their careers by forgiving borrowers' remaining balance after they made the 120 qualifying monthly payments.

Most commercial planes reach between 150 and 180 miles per hour before takeoff depending on the weight of the aircraft. So, the impact of the charter plane could have been lethal. \"In the years I’ve been doing this, I’ve never heard a ATC controller tell a plane to ‘Stop, stop, stop,’\" the plane spotter was heard saying.

        "content": "Donna Major's husband Danny Jenkins and daughters Heather Turner and Katie Jenkins call out President Biden for commuting the death sentence of her murderer. A South Carolina manconvicted in the brutal double murder of two bank employees in 2017 is asking for a \"compassionate release\" days after President Biden spared his life and commuted his death sentence. Brandon Council, 28, was convicted in September 2019 in the 2017 double murder of Conway bank employees Katie Skeen, 36, and Donna Major, 59. Council was then sentenced to death by a federal court one month later. Council was one of 37 federal inmates on death row who had their sentences commuted to life in prison by Biden. On Friday, Council filed a motion in the U.S. District Court in Florence arguing that he deserved a \"compassionate release\" because he had been subjected to \"severe, unnecessary, and unjustifiable psychological harm\" that \"can only be accurately construed and assimilated as an act of torture,\" since he was permanently housed in solitary confinement since Nov. 4, 2019,according to records obtained by WBTW. TRUMP EXECUTION RESTART TO PUT BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER, CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTER, MORE KILLERS IN HOT SEAT Brandon Council is one of 37 federal death row inmates who escaped execution following President Biden's decision to commute their sentences.(DeathPenaltyInfo.org) A compassionate release is described bythe American Bar Organizationas the process by which those incarcerated may seek early release, whether to community supervision or to their communities, due to extraordinary or compelling circumstances. Several people have openly disagreed with Biden’s decision to commute the death sentences, including Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C., who said the decision was \"shameful.\" \"Biden’s move to pardon 37 federal death row inmates - including 3 men from South Carolina who committed unspeakable acts - continues to shock Americans nationwide. This decision is shameful. It is high time to return America to a country of law and order,\" Fry wrote in a post on X. Fry added in another post following the announcement that Biden's decision \"disgraces victims’ memories nationwide.\" \"Joe Biden’s clemency for death row inmates disgraces victims’ memories nationwide, like Donna Major of Conway and Katie Skeen of Green Sea. This shows shocking disregard for innocent families’ pain, right at Christmas. January 20 cannot come soon enough,\" Fry wrote in his post on X. Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., echoed Fry and called Biden's actions \"senseless.\" \"President Biden's decision to commute the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates is not just senseless—it's an outrageous example of this administration's upside down and backwards ideology,\" Meuser wrote in a post on his X account. FAMILY OF MURDERED SC WOMAN RAGES AT BIDEN FOR COMMUTING KILLER'S DEATH SENTENCE: 'SHE WAS SHOWN NO MERCY' During an interview with\"Fox & Friends,\"Major's family said they were livid after Biden commuted her killer's death sentence just days before Christmas. \"I was angry. I'm still angry. I am upset that this is even happening, that one man can make this decision without even talking to the victims, without any regard for what we've been through, what we're going through, and completely hurt, frustrated and angry,\" Major's daughter Heather Turner said during the Christmas Eve interview. Donna Major, 59, and Kathryn (Katie) Skeen, 36, were killed in cold blood by Brandon Council while he robbed a South Carolina bank in 2017.(Derek Shoemake) \"She was shown no mercy at all. This man walked into the bank, never said two words to her. Shot her three times in total. He went and shot her coworker, Katie Skeen as well, who was totally defenseless and unaware of anything happening,\" Major's husband, Danny Jenkins, added during the show. \"I can't even believe that this is actually happening…\" Council spent a week at a motel across from the CresCom Bank in Conway, South Carolina, where he watched the movie \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" before he went in with a gun and killed both Skeen and Major. Council already had a prior felony conviction at the time and told an FBI agent that he went into the bank knowing he wouldkill someone during the robbery. He had been on parole for a month at the time of the murders, which came during his second bank robbery since leaving prison. FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IN DEATH ROW CASE SPEAKS ON BIDEN COMMUTING MURDERER'S SENTENCE: 'MY HEART ACHES' President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end theBiden-Harris administration'smoratorium on federal executions when he returns to office. Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Christmas Day to call out Biden for his commutation decision. \"They know that their only chance of survival is getting pardons from a man who has absolutely no idea what he is doing,\" Trump's post read. \"Also, to the 37 most violent criminals who killed, raped, and plundered like virtually no one before them, but were just given, incredibly, a pardon by Sleepy Joe Biden. I refuse to wish a Merry Christmas to those lucky ‘souls’ but instead, will say, GO TO HELL!\" Trump continued.

        "content": "WARNING, Graphic Content: FOX Business' Cheryl Casone joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board sending investigators to probe deadly South Korean plane crash. The death toll for what amounted to be South Korea's most fatal plane crash in decades stands at 179 people on Monday, a day after the disaster gripped the nation alreadyin intense political turmoil. The United States is now sending investigators to help determine what caused the Jeju Air plane to crash-land at Muan airport and slam into a concrete barrier on Sunday. Meanwhile,South Korean officialsare combing through more than 600 body parts, and the stench of blood remains in the air at the crash site, the Daily Mail reported. So far, 141 bodies have been identified. The youngest passenger was a 3-year-old and the oldest was 78, the BBC reported. South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, wearing a green jacket, visits the site of a plane fire at Muan International Airport in Muan, South Korea, on Monday, Dec. 30, 2024.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) The plane had 181 people on board, and just two lone survivors – identified as 32-year-old Lee and 25-year-old Kwon, both flight attendants – were pulled from the tail end of the fiery aircraft alive. Doctors at Mokpo Korean Hospital reportedly described how Lee, who suffered a fractured left shoulder and head injuries but remained conscious, repeatedly asked them \"What happened?\" and \"Why am I here?\"\"It seems she was in a near-panic state, possibly worried about the safety of the plane and passengers,\" one hospital official told the Korean Times. AVIATION EXPERT CASTS DOUBT ON BIRD STRIKE THEORY IN DEADLY SOUTH KOREAN PLANE CRASH: 'DOESN'T MAKE SENSE'Kwon, who is being treated at Mokpo Central Hospital, suffered a scalp laceration, a fractured ankle and abdominal pain, according to the report. She also had no immediate recollection of the crash. \"While her life is not in danger, the trauma and injuries are significant,\" another hospital said, according to the Korean Times. South Korea's Transport Ministry said Monday it plans to conduct safety inspections of all of the 101 Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country’s airlines as well as a broader review into safety standards at Jeju Air, which operates 39 of those planes. Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation. \"The NTSB is leading a team of U.S. investigators (NTSB, Boeing and FAA) to assist the Republic of Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) with their investigation of the Dec. 29 Jeju Air accident at Muan International Airport in Muan, Republic of Korea,\" the NTSB Newsroom account wrote on X. Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport’s localizer — a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings — should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa. Sunday's crash, the country’s worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments ofPresident Yoon Suk Yeoland Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon’s brief imposition of martial law earlier this month. New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country’s aircraft operation systems. \"The essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\" Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister, said, according to the Associated Press.

Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball. The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33, according to the AP. Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families. \"I demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\" he said, choking down tears. Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul’s Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure. South Korean national flags fly at half-mast at the government complex in Seoul, South Korea, on Monday, Dec. 30, 2024.(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) Joo said officials were reviewing whether there might have been communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot. \"Our current understanding is that, at some point during the go-around process, communication became somewhat ineffective or was interrupted, ahead of the landing and impact,\" he said. Ministry officials said Monday the plane’s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash. The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board. The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-daynational mourning periodthrough Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people. Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida, told the AP. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said. Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They told the AP there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

PILE OF 'GARBAGE' FOODS WITH DEBATABLE TOPPINGS IS A DELICACY IN THIS US CITY Two restaurant industry professionals shared their views on when it is OK — and when it's not — to ask for a to-go box after a meal. Here are three issues that are sparking debate. At some restaurant chains – think Cheesecake Factory, Texas Road House andRed Lobster– the complimentary bread served before the meal is as much of a draw as the entrées themselves. Is it ever OK to take leftover bread home after a meal?(iStock) But is it ever OK to takeleftover breadhome after a meal?

One restaurateur told Fox News Digital he would be \"flattered\" if someone took home the complimentary bread from the table.(iStock) Another person disagreed with that assessment. Kelli Ferrell, an Atlanta-based restaurateur, said that she personally is \"not a big bread person\" — and that she, as a customer dining out, would not take complimentary bread home from a restaurant. \"I get it,\" she said, noting that the rolls served at Texas Roadhouse are \"one of her favorites.\" MOM CHARGES FAMILY FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER AND MORE: ‘IT’S JUST SO EXPENSIVE' \"I think it's like a little treat,\" she told Fox News Digital.

It's about \"making the experience more comfortable for [people] and making sure they are feeling appreciated,\" said one restaurant owner.(iStock) This is not a big deal, both Ferrell and Friedlander told Fox News Digital. \"In my business, I tell my employees I don't want them to say ‘no’ to anything as long as we can possibly do it,\" Friedlander said.

While Ferrell said most items are perfectly fine to be packaged to-go, there's one exception: eggs. \"Eggs are always kind of a no-no. I can take everything else but that.\" \"Eggs for meare always kind of a no-no,\" she said, in terms of being wrapped to go. \"I can take everything else but that.\" Eggs, she said, are best served hot and freshly cooked.

The outlet reported in September that eight people had been killed on subway trains in New York City, up from five during the same period in 2023. After last week’s brutal killing, Sliwa announced the Guardian Angels would be making a return to the New York subway and beefing up its presence on trains throughout the city. He said group members would be conducting wellness checks on homeless individuals and alerting police and subway authorities when there are problems. \"We’re going to have to increase our numbers, increase the training and increase our presence as we did back in 1979,\" said Sliwa. \"We went from 13 to 1,000 back then within a period of a year.

We need to rescue these people and get them mental health care. Shame on the fact that the mayor spent billions of our tax dollars housing migrants, but not our own citizens who live in the subways.

Egg productionin the U.S. dropped 4% in November as the price of eggs and cases of bird flu continue to rise across the country, according to a report from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service announced that in the month of November, egg production totaled 8.92 billion, which was down 4% from the same period last year. Of the 8.92 billion eggs produced, 7.68 billion were table eggs and 1.24 billion were hatching eggs, the key difference being that eating eggs are unfertilized and unable to become a chick. Also, in November, there were 376 million egg-laying eggs, down 3% from last year, and for every 100 layers, there was an average of 2,374 eggs produced.

The news comes as egg prices are rising, a trend industry experts say will persist into 2025 if Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), also known as \"bird flu\" infections, continue. Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute Sector Manager Kevin Bergquist said egg prices have been elevated since 2023 due to the combination of seasonal price increases during the holidays and disruption in egg supply due to bird flu. HERE'S WHY GROCERS ARE REALLY RAISING PRICES Modern chicken farm for the breeding of white chickens and eggs, multi-level conveyor, indoor, copy space, poultry farming(iStock / iStock) Prices over the past year have \"generally\" remained above 2023 prices and even \"often exceeded egg prices from 2022, which was when HPAI really caught the egg market,\" according to Bergquist. Wholesale egg prices, which jumped nearly 55% in November, do not necessarily reflect consumer eggprices at the grocer,which can vary widely. According to the Consumer Price Index, grocery prices rose 0.5% in November, with four of the six major grocery store food groups rising in cost. Eggs showed the largest increase by a wide margin. EGG PRICES ARE HIGHER AND WILL CONTINUE INTO 2025 In the hands of a woman packing eggs in the supermarket(iStock / iStock) Prices for meat, poultry, and fish rose 1.7% in November, but prices for eggs rose 8.2%. Prior to the large bird flu outbreakin March 2022, flock numbers were at a level that supported lower egg prices, according to Bergquist. He noted the wholesale price was less than $1.50 per dozen. However, the outbreak disrupted the market, leading to record egg prices in December 2022. The average price corrected to a lower level by 2023 as producers rebuilt their flocks. Bergquist said that the flock size was hindered again when bird flu re-emerged in late 2023 and into 2024, resulting in under-supplied egg markets.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks with Donald Trump during a campaign event at the Butler Farm Show, Saturday, Oct. 5, 2024, in Butler, Pa.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Musk's social media post over the holidays turned heads, considering Kennedy has expressed opposition to semaglutide. Originally developed as a diabetes medication, semaglutide has been used more widely in recent years for its appetite-suppressing effects. \"There's a huge push to sell this to the American people,\" Kennedy said of the semaglutide medication Ozempic when asked about his thoughts on the medication in October by Fox News' Greg Gutfeld. \"They make this drug in Denmark, and in Denmark they do not recommend it for diabetes, or for obesity. They recommend dietary and behavioral changes.\" \"They're counting on selling it to Americans because we are so stupid and so addicted to drugs,\" Kennedy added. He also concluded that the U.S. could solvethe obesity crisisin America \"overnight\" if they just had access to, and ate, better quality food. WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS COULD SHAKE UP FOOD INDUSTRY Kennedy has run on a platform to\"Make America Healthy Again,\"but Ozempic, he says, will not help in those efforts. Musk, however, has said that \"nothing would do more to improve public health\" than making Ozempic more widely available. During President Joe Biden's final days in office, his administration proposed expandingMedicare and Medicaid coverage for semaglutidesto make them more widely available for those who want to reap the weight-losing benefits of the drug.

While Donald Trump's allies have been steadfast in defending most of his Cabinet choices, some of the President-elect's nominees have caused a stir from both sides of the aisle. Now, Fox Nation dives deep into each pick — however controversial — in its latest episodic series, \"The Cabinet.\" ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. Trump’s secretary nominee for the Department of Health and Human Services (HSS)has caused some controversy. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ran as an Independent in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, but on Aug. 23 he dropped out and announced his support for Trump. If he is confirmed by the Senate, RFK Jr. plans to re-evaluate many health policies, from vaccines to ultra-processed foods. This initiative explains the viral motto, \"Make America Healthy Again,\" which summarizes his ambitions in the Trump administration. RFK JR. SAYS HE PLANS TO ALSO MEET WITH DEMS IN BID TO GET CONFIRMED AS TRUMP HHS HEAD \"It ended up bringing a lot of credibility to the campaign,\" Fox News contributor Charles Hurt said on RFK Jr.'s endorsement. \"I normally don't think endorsements matter that much,\" he continued. \"But I think that RFK's endorsement of Trump made a huge difference.\" Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s alliance with Trump may have changed the course of the election, Charles Hurt argues.(REUTERS/Go Nakamura) SEN. MARCO RUBIO During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., traded barbs and insults with Trump. However, despite their differences, the two politicians joined forces during Trump’s first term, and the Florida senator became known as a loyal supporter of the president. In November, Rubio was nominated as United States Secretary of State and awaits his confirmation from the Senate. \"He has a lot of the qualities that Trump likes,\" Fox News contributor Miranda Devine saidin the Fox Nation episode. \"He's just a good politician.

Noem’s nomination was a surprise to many, but Fox News contributor Ben Domenech said she \"is someone who can be a go-between with Congress.\" Domenech also added that she has the potential to be a \"more traditional person in this role,\" meaning she can build upon her relationships with fellow Republicans.

        "content": "St. Sebastian, a third century martyr, has been revered as a saint for nearly 2,000 years. Not much is known for certain about St. Sebastian, an early Christian martyr, but his life story has been shared and admired for millennia. He was referred to as a saint long before the official canonization process was established. St. Sebastian's story ofdeep faithin the face of persecution has been inspiring Christians ever since his martyrdom at the order of the Roman emperor Diocletian. This patron saint of athletes and soldiers is the subject of the latest installment of legendary filmmakerMartin Scorsese's \"The Saints,\" streaming now on Fox Nation. MARTIN SCORSESE ILLUMINATES HISTORY'S BOLDEST SAINTS IN FOX NATION SERIES HE 'DIDN'T KNOW COULD BE DONE' \"The stories of the early saints were spread from person to person, and they gradually became legend – that is, the realm where historical truth gives way to a spiritual truth,\" Scorsese narrates. Since his martyrdom, St. Sebastian has \"lived on as a kind of prototype, a supreme example, of absolute and undying faith,\" he also says. St. Sebastian, a third-century martyr, is seen here in the latest episode of \"The Saints.\"(Fox Nation) The episode takes viewers back to the streets of third century Rome, at a time when Christians were about to be under intense persecution by the Roman emperor – Diocletian. Diocletian \"wanted to bring back the glory days of the Pax Romana, to make Rome great again,\" said Scorsese. Among the steps taken by Diocletian was a return to Rome's pagan religion, with a pantheon of gods. MARTIN SCORSESE SAYS HIS NEW FOX NATION SERIES 'THE SAINTS' WAS A STORY HE ALWAYS WANTED TO TELL Previously, noted Scorsese,Christian beliefshad been tolerated, \"but Diocletian reverted to the old ways. He ruled by divine right of the Roman gods, making anyone who refused to worship them a threat to his power.\" Sebastian, who at the time was a commander of the Praetorian Guard, an elite cohort of soldiers who were charged with protecting the emperor, is keeping a secret: He is a Christian. Sebastian (second from right) convinced Nicostratus (second from left) to let him talk to Marcellus and Marcellianus in private in this scene from \"The Saints.\"(Fox Nation) Meanwhile, twin brothers and deacons, Marcellus and Marcellianus, had been captured and were imprisoned. In their cell, they were told if they made a sacrifice to the Roman gods, they would be released without further punishment. Their parents, Tranquillinus and Martia, are not Christians. The parents were not previously aware of their sons' faiths — and they tell their sons to make the sacrifice. MARTIN SCORSESE BRINGS JOHN THE BAPTIST'S STORY OF DEFIANCE AND FAITH TO FOX NATION Sebastian tells the guard, Nicostratus, that he wishes to speak to Marcellus and Marcellianus alone. He reveals to the brothers that he, too, is a Christian and encourages them to remain steadfast in their faith. \"Brother, don't you believe?\" asks Sebastian. \"Then you must know, we only answer to the one true God. Not to our ancestors, not toour elders, not to our father, not to our mother – to God.\" Following God, as Sebastian reminds the brothers, is the \"only way of salvation\" — and while they may be tortured or killed, their persecutors \"can't touch your soul.\" Sebastian showed Marcellus and Marcellianus his fish symbol, revealing himself as a Christian, in this scene from \"The Saints.\"(Fox Nation) Overhearing Sebastian's message to Marcellus and Marcellianus, Nicostratus confronts them, before dropping his sword and falling to his knees, overcome with emotion. \"It was impossible, unthinkable,\" said Scorsese. \"Nicostratus, the terror of all Roman Christians, hadconverted to Christianity. He freed all of his prisoners, and he had his entre household baptized.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER This was the start of \"dramatic, mass conversions\" that were happening throughout Rome, said Scorsese. \"And Sebastian was at the secret heart of it all.\" All would not stay well, however. Nicostratus, Marcellus and Marcellianus would all soon be martyred, and Sebastian's Christianity would be discovered. St. Sebastian is often portrayed as pierced by arrows.(Juan Naharro Gimenez/Getty Images) Sebastian, too, would see the same fate as his fellow Christians – but he would not go down quietly. \"The Saints\" follows the lives and legacies of saints such as Sebastian, who serve as examples of tenacity, courage and righteousness in the face of adversity.

For those of you who might not know or are too young to understand, the A-10 is an insane piece of military equipment. It's essentially a punch of firepower attached to a joystick more than it is a traditional plane. The entire purpose of the A-10 is to come in and smack targets at close range. The GAU-8 Avenger fires a 30mm round, and nobody on the planet wants to be on the business end of it. If you are, then you're almost certainly dead. The video also does a great job of showing the incredible skill and talent of the pilots who have to come flying in and shoot bad guys at dangerously close ranges.

One woman's friend didn’t get that memo ahead of her 21st birthday party. She hooked up with her friend's dad at the party and took to a Facebook group to find out if she is a bad person for doing so. A woman's friend hooked up with her dad during her 21st birthday party. (Image Credit: Getty) The 19-year-old ignored the fact that it was her friend's birthday, and she ignored the 30-year age gap she had with her friend's 49-year-old dad. Now she sees a future with him. She wrotein an extremely long runon sentence, \"Last weekend I went to a friends birthday party it was her 21st I'm 19 her dad was home I was having shots with her dad 49yr old we got a bit drunk and ended up having sex around the back of the house does this make me a bad person?\" I know what you're thinking, besides the fact that that was an insanely written sentence, that sounds romantic. Well, you're not alone there. The 19-year-old thinks so too. She added in much shorter sentences, \"I really like him tho I could really see a future with him. What do I do?!?\" Now some of the sensible people in the Facebook group felt that she had been taken advantage of by her friend's dad. That's a reasonable position to take, but do we have to rain so hard on her parade? One of those dumping on her responded, according to theDaily Mail, \"You can see a future with this man based on what? Doing shots and getting it on in the back yard?\" Every love story starts somewhere. I'm sure there's a happily ever after out there that started by taking shots and hooking up with a friend's dad in a backyard. Admittedly, it makes her a bad friend. You could argue, it makes her the worst friend ever. But it also makes her a dreamer. Another in the group pointed out, \"I am also willing to bet that the daddy doesn't see a future with you, just the fun of a young chick.\" Comments about lost friendships and seeking professional help didn’t hit home quite as hard as this one did. The person wrote, \"So your friends dad took advantage of you when you were drunk? He sounds like a creep. Not normal at all.\" Well, there is that. Scratch the whole romance thing and stay far away from that guy, unless he's loaded. That changes the situation slightly. Is there enough in the bank account to overlook his drunken creepiness?

Brandon Quandt, the face behind theKILLIN' ITYouTube channel and part of the Drury Outdoors family, was recently out on a late-seasonhuntwith Jaylenwhen the bizarre incident occurred. \"Jaylen, 9 years old, climbed into the stand with high hopes,\"Drury Outdoors posted on Facebook. \"As daylight faded, her target buck that ended up getting sick stepped into range. She made a fantastic shot with minutes to spare! \"But the real surprise came during the recovery. They found his antlers lying on the ground- he has shed his rack on the way down! Jaylen’s biggest buck yet turned into a memory she’ll never forget!\" Bucks, of course, shed their antlers every year — usually between January and March. Bucks that are in poor health or injured may shed their antlers sooner. But the odds of witnessing the event just a split second after pulling the trigger are slim to none. Jaylen seemed to be in good spirits, and folks in the comments were quick to weigh in. Tag it as a doe, save that buck tag. It now identifies as an antler-less deer. That’s seriously one amazing memory! How many other people can say they have one like it?! Awesome buck young lady! That was such a perfect shot that it knocked the antlers right off his head!

        "content": "Following the Indianapolis Colts' shocking loss to the previously two-win New York Giants on Sunday, a loss that knocked the Colts out of NFL playoff contention, ESPN star Pat McAfeewent OFF on the state of the teamled by head coachShane Steichen. McAfee played for theColtsfor the entirety of his eight-year NFL career and continues to live in Indianapolis. He's also a season ticket holder for the team. But, according to McAfee, he's \"not renewing\" his tickets after the disastrous results this season from a team talented enough to win the AFC South. In addition, McAfee noted several problems with this year's Colts team. One of those issues, according to McAfee, is that players are often late to meetings. While McAfee never mentioned Steichen by name, it's hard not to point the finger at the head coach for many of the issues that McAfee raised. If players are late to meetings, and there's a \"loser attitude radiating\" through the team, that falls on the coach. Colts beat reporter Bob Kravitz asked Steichen specifically about McAfee's claim that players are often late to meetings. Indianapolis Colts head coach Shane Steichen does not seem concerned that his players aren't always on time for practices and meetings. (Robert Deutsch/Imagn Images) Not only did Steichen not deny the allegation, he gave arguably the worst answer an NFL coach could give in that situation. \"Not everyone's going to be on time, every time,\" Steichen responded. Wait, what? Steichen went on to talk about the team having accountability, but it's hard to see where that comes from when punctuality isn't even demanded by the head coach. Being on time is such a small detail and one that should be the bare minimum expected by an NFL head coach. The fact that Steichen seems to brush it off is not a good sign for his future as a head coach. Pat McAfee wields a lot of power in Indianapolis, so it's also a very bad sign for Steichen that McAfee publicly called out the team's culture as he did on Sunday. It might not be all Steichen's fault – the drafting of Anthony Richardson as the franchise QB only to find out that he'swilling to sub out of critical game situations because he's \"tired\"looks bad in retrospect – but winning culture starts with the head coach. Ask Andy Reid, Mike Tomlin, or either of the Harbaugh brothers about that. They'll tell you that accountability and culture begins with them. Steichen seems willing to allow the players to control the culture and, right now, that's not working. Changes are probably coming in Indianapolis. We'll just have to wait and see what that looks like. Dan began his sports media career at ESPN, where he survived for nearly a decade.

        "content": "Despite years of declining religious affiliation, print Bible sales have spiked. A first-time Bible buyer and Bishop Robert Barron both weighed in on the trend. Briana Fitzpatrick grew up in a Christian family and felt a strong connection to a higher power. But it wasn't until this time last year that the young, New York-based artist finally decided to buy her first Bible. The inspiration came to Fitzpatrick as she was sitting with her father, watching a documentary about\"Duck Dynasty\" star Phil Robertson. \"He pulled out his Bible and … you could tell he'd had it for decades and decades. It was just held together with duct tape,\" Fitzpatrick toldFox News Digital. She began to imagine having her own Bible that she could pass down for generations, filled with highlights and notes that her children could read and \"see how the Lord spoke to me through it.\" Fitzpatrick is among the young, first-time Bible buyers publishers say are fueling a new surge in sales. Artist Briana Fitzpatrick's father regularly read the Bible to her as a child, and as she grew up, she downloaded a free Bible app. But that came with pop-ups and other advertisements she said distracted from her reading. And she missed being able to put pen to paper, highlighting and taking notes as she read. So last December, she bought her first physical Bible.(Photos courtesy Briana Fitzpatrick/via Instagram) 'MARY' MOVIE PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON THE MOTHER OF GOD Bible salesrose 22% through October compared to the same period last year, according to data released this month by Circana Bookscan. Total U.S. print book sales were only up 1%, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the trend. \"The religion book market has been a bright spot of growth within the total book market since the pandemic,\" Brenna Connor, an industry analyst with Circana, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Bibles are leading that growth, but other subjects like Christian Life and Biblical Studies are also up, reflecting increased interest for Christian subjects in the U.S.\" Print Bible sales hit a five-year low of just under 8.9 million in 2020, according to Circana's data, before beginning to tick upward again. Sales surpassed 13.7 million in the first 10 months of this year, Circana reported. The increase in Bible sales comes even as polling shows a decline in religiosity across the country. The share of Americans identifying with a Christian religion hit a low of 68% last year, according toGallup polling. Half a century ago, 87% of adults in the U.S. identified as Christian, Gallup found. About 28% of American adults are now religiously unaffiliated, according toPew Research. \"Some people, sure they're not going back to church, but they are reaching out to the Bible,\" Minnesota-basedBishop Robert Barrontold Fox News Digital. Bishop Robert Barron attributed the surge in Bible sales to a renewed search for meaning, purpose and value.(Fox News Digital) SATANIC TEMPLE'S NATIVITY DISPLAY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE DESTROYED, DEM REP CALLS FOR NEW DISPLAY \"Let's face it, the Bible has been — certainly for Western civilization, but even all over the world — the main source of meaning, purpose, value,\" Barron said. \"I think people are turning back to the Bible in greater numbers because they're looking for that, and they realize instinctively they're going to find it.\" He also speculated thatCanadian psychologist Jordan Petersoncould be adding to the trend, since he has been \"talking about the biblical text in a way that people find very compelling.\" Barron added that he's seeing a notable shift away from the New Atheism of the early 2000s. \"I think in the beginning some people thought, 'Oh, great. Stick it to the man, and I'm against religion.' But when you take that message in, what are you left with? It's a complete nihilism,\" Barron said, adding that he hasn't been surprised by rising rates ofdepression, anxietyandsuicidal ideation, particularly among young people. \"That's what happens when you say there's no meaning or purpose.\" Publishers similarly suggested the Bible boom could be a natural consequence of a general feeling of anxiety in the world. \"I do think people are hungry for truth, and hungry for purpose and meaning and a sense of direction, especially for the past few years,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I think a lot of us are like, what is going on? Who do we trust? What do we turn to?'\" Fitzpatrick said the most impactful verse she has read in the year since buying her Bible is Matthew 6:33. \"'Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and the rest shall follow,'\" she recited.(iStock) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fitzpatrick said having a physical Bible revolutionized her spiritual journey. She has read the Bible every day since making the purchase, and even started attending Bible study groups.

The air conditioning blew a frigid breeze through theBroward County Jailin south Florida. Guards walked by wearing coats and beanies. It was Christmas Eve. Her son, a Marine, was leaving on Dec. 27 to spend three years stationed in Okinawa, Japan.

Box is now suing theBroward Sheriff's Office, alleging deputies violated her Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure when they failed to do \"basic due diligence to confirm whether the person they planned to arrest was actually subject to the arrest warrant.\" Box and her husband rushed to the front of the line, eager to get off the cruise ship on Christmas Eve 2022. They had just spent six days at sea with Box's brother, celebrating his second recovery from cancer. Now, Box wanted to get home to celebrate Christmas with her kids, the last time for at least three years the family would all be together before her son left for Okinawa. But when she scanned her badge to disembark, staff said security needed to meet with Box. Soon, police and Customs and Border Protection surrounded Box and her husband. \"They asked if I was Jennifer Heath,\" she recalled. Box kept Heath as her middle name after marrying her husband. She repeatedly asked the law enforcement officers standing around her what was going on. Eventually, they said they had a warrant for her from Harris County, Texas. \"It's for endangering a child,\" a deputy said. Box's eyes went wide. Her husband said, \"I think y'all have the wrong person.\" Police had a warrant for \"Jennifer Delcarmen Heath,\" who was 23 years younger and nearly half a foot shorter than the \"Jennifer\" who had just gotten off a cruise ship.

Jennifer Heath Box, who was 48 years old at the time, had no minor children. The suspect on the warrant was younger than one of her daughters. \"Endangering a child? What child would I endanger?\" Box asked, stunned. Officers handcuffed her and put her in a sheriff's office SUV, where interior video shows Box continuing to insist there must be some mistake as she was transported to the Broward County Jail. The booking officer said she didn't see any warrants in the system for Box when she scanned her driver's license, but Deputy Peter Peraza insisted that they book her anyway, according to the lawsuit filed against the sheriff's office, Peraza and other deputies and corrections staff. Box's attorneys at the Institute for Justice, anonprofit civil liberties law firm, said Broward County deputies overlooked at least 10 significant discrepancies between Box and the subject of the warrant, including the vast age and height disparities, different Social Security and FBI numbers and contrasting eye, hair and skin colors. The only information that implicated Box was a copy of her DMV photo that had been attached to the warrant. Box felt humiliated and terrified as she was strip searched, given a prison uniform and placed in a cold, dirty cell, where she said she witnessed continuous screaming and violence in the adjoining men's area. She woke up Christmas morning after a restless night shivering on the floor next to a stranger and was denied bond because the other \"Jennifer\" had an extradition warrant, according to the lawsuit. Harris County had up to 30 days to come get her, an officer allegedly told Box. At home, both Box's brother and her husband were fighting layers of bureaucracy. Officials with Harris County said they needed BSO to send over the warrant and Box's fingerprints for comparison, but BSO refused, according to the suit.

I'll never get to have that opportunity to have those memories.\" She recalled talking to the officer who escorted her out of the detention center about all the things she had missed out on over the holidays. His demeanor started \"completely arrogant,\" she said, but softened when she told him she didn't get to see her son before he left for theMarine Corps. \"'Things happen,'\" Box remembered the officer saying. That was the closest she ever got to an apology. The Broward Sheriff’s Office toldFox News Digitalin a statement that it \"sympathizes with the difficult situation Ms. Jennifer Heath Box was in,\" but blamed Harris County for the mishap. \"Had it not been for the arrest warrant filed by the Harris County Sheriff’s Office, Customs and Border Patrol would not have flagged Ms. Box, BSO would not have been notified, and she would not have been arrested,\" a spokesperson wrote. The statement added that the \"actions of the BSO deputy involved in arresting Ms. Box were reviewed by the Broward Sheriff’s Office Internal Affairs Division, and no employee misconduct was found.\" Institute for Justiceattorney Jared McClain said that while Harris County and CBP also made mistakes in the case, it \"does not excuse the behavior of Officer Peraza and the Broward County Sheriff’s Office.\" \"They had a duty to ensure that the person they were arresting was actually the subject of the warrant--especially in the face of Jennifer's repeated and credible insistence that they had the wrong person.\" CBP flagged Box's name to BSO before she left for the cruise, according to her lawyers, giving deputies ample time to confirm her identity \"before they decided to arrest the wrong Jennifer.\" GEORGIA CITY TO PAY $55,000, TRAIN OFFICERS ON FREE SPEECH AFTER VETERAN ARRESTED FOR 'PANHANDLING' Jennifer Heath Box is one of at least 160 people named \"Jennifer Heath\" living in Texas, according to her lawsuit.(Fox News Digital) BSO made similar errors in at least two othermistaken identityarrests, including one in which a man spent five days in jail before police ran his fingerprints and confirmed he was the wrong person, according to the suit. \"Despite this history of jailing innocent people who share a name with someone with an outstanding warrant, Broward County failed to adequately train its officers or implement new policies, practices, or customs ensuring that BSO staff verify the identities of arrestees,\" the suit alleges.

Free speech advocates are crying foul after they say an Iowa social studies teacher banned the use of a lengthy list of words and phrases in her classroom, including the name of an entire state. But officials from the school now say students helped create the list, and that it's no longer on display. On Tuesday, the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) wrote to officials at the Fremont-Mills Community School District, warning that a seventh-grade social studies teacher's allegedspeech banis unconstitutional. \"Everyone agrees that teachers have a duty to prevent classroom disruption, but a blanket ban on specific words and topics, regardless of the context, goes too far,\" Aaron Terr, director of public advocacy for thecivil liberties group, told Fox News Digital in an email.

The poster further includes a blanket ban on meowing, barking, curse words, racist comments, LGBTQ+ and fat jokes, and references to drugs, Nazis or the Holocaust. School administrators told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement Thursday afternoon that students helped craft the list \"as an important lesson of civic responsibility … promoting empathy and awareness of how language affects others.\" They added that the \"chart has not been displayed since the first quarter.\" \"Our goal is not to censor or stifle student speech, but to guide students toward language that fosters a positive and inclusive learning environment,\" officials from the rural district located insouthwestern Iowaadded.

A parent told FIRE that at least 10 students have been disciplined, but school administrators said \"consequences are not based solely upon using particular words, unless they are considered vulgar, lewd, threatening, a substantial disruption of the school environment, or bullying toward another student.\" FIRE acknowledged that schools have a \"legitimate interest in preventing actual classroom disruptions,\" but said categorically banning a list of terms — including common words like \"Ohio\" and \"chat\" — without regard to context violates students' free speech rights. \"It is well-established that public school students do not shed their First Amendment rights at the schoolhouse gate,\" Terr wrote to the school's principal and superintendent, citing the landmark 1969 Supreme Court decision inTinker v.

A rural Iowa school district says a teacher's list of \"Banned Words\" was created with the input of students during a civics lesson. \"We acknowledge that evolving language and slang from social media platforms plays a tremendous role in students’ interactions,\" the district wrote in a statement. \"While these expressions can be creative and accepted, they may also carry meanings or connotations that may disrupt the classroom or negatively affect peers.\"(iStock) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP FIRE called on the district to remove the list, \"stop censoring non-disruptive student expression,\" and respond by Dec. 23.

The state Senate's top Republican responded Thursday by saying the majority party is \"asking the wrong question.\" Earlier this week, House Speaker Don Scott Jr. wrote a letter to the commonwealth's unemployment agency warning of the fallout from such a plan and a potential uptick in unemployment claims. \"We should all be concerned about what these changes mean for the employees raising their families in Virginia, paying taxes in Virginia and calling Virginia home,\" Scott wrote to Virginia Employment Commissioner Demetrios Melis in a letter reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Scott reportedly said he believes Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads area he represents would be hardest-hit. \"I have concerns that, in the coming months, not only will our nation experience a mass increase in unemployment due to the proposed changes to our government. But, more importantly, those changes will have a detrimental effect on Virginians, our commonwealth’s unemployment rate and our economy overall,\" he told the Times-Dispatch. However, Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-New Kent, said the concept of DOGE addresses a greater concern for Virginians and U.S. taxpayers when it comes to fiscally responsible governance. \"That's the wrong question,\" McDougle said in an interview Thursday. YOUNGKIN ‘PERSONALLY INVITES’ NEW TRUMP ADMIN TO SETTLE IN VA OVER MD, DC \"The question should be whether we are taking dollars that Virginians are earning and paying to the federal government and whether they are being spent wisely. \"If the federal government is paying people to do jobs they shouldn't be doing, then that's spending taxpayer dollars unwisely.\" Trump's DOGE co-leader, Vivek Ramaswamy,previously told Fox Business, \"We expect mass reductions … [and] certain agencies to be deleted outright.\" Ramaswamy's counterpart, Elon Musk, has expressed similar sentiments,including a tweet stating, \"Delete CFPB,\" a reference to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additionally, Sen. Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican seen as the top DOGE lawmaker in the upper chamber,is spearheading a bill to relocateabout one-third of federal workers outside the District of Columbia-Maryland-Virginia area. The legislation proposed by Ernst has a lengthy acronym, the DRAIN THE SWAMP Act. Virginia Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover/New Kent(Virginia Senate) Ernst also demanded answers from Biden agency heads about work-from-home policies their staffs enjoy. In his remarks Thursday, McDougle added that if Democrats were so concerned about the subject, they should have balked at plans to funnel Virginia taxpayer funds to the Washington-area Metro system to \"subsidize\" the lack of ridership from telework policies criticized by Ernst. \"I didn't feel our Democratic friends were as concerned with the millions of dollars going to fund Metro amid [federal workers not being required to] go into the office and having to subsidize them,\" McDougle said. Virginia's 2024 budget included about $144 million in Metro funding.

Youngkin earlier this month invited workers in Trump's incoming administration to choose Virginia as their place of residence over Maryland or the District of Columbia, citing, in part, lower taxes and better-ranked schools. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said Virginia's economy was \"stagnant\" and the unemployment system \"in shambles\" when the Republican took office after eight years of Democratic governorship. \"Commonsense policies to lower the cost of living and bring real business-like efficiency to government have helped fix both,\" Martinez said. \"The governor appreciates Speaker Scott’s recent commitments to support further tax relief, which, along with a roaring economy and over 300,000 open jobs, means Virginia is in a great position as the president works to shrink the bloated federal government.\" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

        "content": "Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson has the latest on the Trump transition and talks over the Panama Canal and Greenland on 'The Story.' President-elect Donald Trumpsuggested on Wednesday that the U.S. could take control of Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal—an unexpected Christmas Day message that has sparked concerns among world leaders in recent days as they scramble to prepare for Trump's second White House term. In a Wednesday post on the platform Truth Social, Trump wished a \"Merry Christmas to all,\" including to the \"wonderful soldiers of China, who are lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal,\" before moving on to take aim at Canada and Greenland as well, which he suggested again could be better off under U.S. governance. Trump reiterated his claim that U.S. shippers are beingforced to pay \"ridiculous\" and \"exorbitant\"prices to navigate the Panama Canal—an artificial, 51-mile waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. He has suggested, without evidence, that Chinese interests are gaining outsize influence over the waterway, something Panamanian leaders have steadfastly denied.

Finally, the president-elect turned his attention to Greenland; an autonomous, geographically important Arctic location rife with natural resources, including rare earth minerals. The U.S., Trump said on Wednesday, \"feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity\" for reasons of national security and \"global freedom.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is seen on Nov. 29, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla.(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Bigger picture Trump’s lengthy Truth Social post did little to assuage the concerns of some world leaders, who have carefully watched Trump's actions and his statements in recent weeks for clues as to how he might govern in a second term. The remarks also appear to be at oddswith the \"America First\" policieslong espoused by Trump, which seek to prioritize domestic policy rather than expansion or U.S. presence abroad. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., echoed Trump's concernsin an interview Thursday,describing China's influence in the Panama Canal, and the higher prices incurred by shippers, as a \"shot across the bow.\" \"Remember, we have China and Cuba,\" Zinke said on \"Mornings with Maria.\"\"We have Maduro in Venezuela. We have had Russian ships there. And the Panama Canal is critical to our national security. And at present, it is being run by the Chinese Communist Party. So it's a concern—absolutely.\" 'AMERICA FIRST' VS. 'AMERICA LAST': WHAT DOES TRUMP'S RETURN MEAN FOR US FOREIGN POLICY? Homes are illuminated after the sunset in Tasiilaq, Greenland.(AP Photo/Felipe Dana,) To be sure, it is not the first time Trump has indicated interest in Greenland, a mineral-rich, geographically important territory. In 2019, then-President Trump told reporters he was \"interested\" in purchasing Greenland, which he described at the time as \"essentially\" a \"large real estate deal.\" The 2019 effort never gained traction, however; and this week, Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede immediately poured cold water on the idea that their territory could be sold to the U.S. \"Greenland is ours,\"  Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede said this week, in response to Trump's suggestion. \"We are not for sale and will never be for sale,\" he said. \"We must not lose our long struggle for freedom.\" Meanwhile, Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino also disputed the notion that U.S. vessels have been singled out or paid higher fees to traverse the Panama Canal—as well as the notion that the U.S., which phased out its ownership beginning in the 1970s, has any right to reassert control over the shipping waypoint. In a video posted to social media earlier this week, Mulino reassured his country's people that the \"sovereignty and independence of our country is non-negotiable.\" The Panama Canal is one of the largest and most strategically important commodity shipping waterways in the world. It handles roughly 5% of all global maritime trade and roughly 40% of U.S. container ship traffic. Picturesque Lake Gatun, Panama Canal.(Danuta Hamlin) Recent higher prices are primarily the result of drought and more competition, which sent water levels plummeting last year to their lowest point on record. Though water levels have since rebounded, operators of the canal were forced to temporarily limit vessel traffic and increase costs for ships using the waypoint. Other factors have also played a role in higher maritime shipping prices. A series of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea late last year prompted many major commodities shippers, including BP and Equinor, to pause or reroute their shipments away from the Suez Canal. Some opted to reroute supplies via the Cape of Good Hope, adding weeks of additional time to their trips. The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, incorrectly claimed on social media last week that the Panama Canal cost U.S. taxpayers $15.7 billion. In fact, the higher costs are shouldered by the ships that pass through the waterway, in the form of tolls.  The U.S. government does not subsidize the canal. 'AMERICA FIRST' VS. 'AMERICA LAST': WHAT DOES TRUMP'S RETURN MEAN FOR US FOREIGN POLICY? The gate locks on the Panama Canal open for ship traffic in Dec. 2023. Drought conditions have limited the number of vessels that can travel through the canal per day, adding more price pressure for shipping companies.(Danuta Hamlin) Panamanian authorities have stressed that the prices are not the result of \"unfair\" treatment, or capitulation to China or any other nation-state influence. \"The canal has no direct or indirect control from China, nor the European Union, nor the United States or any other power,\" Mulino said in his remarks. \"As a Panamanian, I reject any manifestation that misrepresents this reality.\" Still, Trump does not appear to be backing down on expansion claims. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The Panama Canal is considered a VITAL National Asset for the United States, due to its critical role to America’s Economy and National Security,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Sunday. \"A secure Panama Canal is crucial for U.S. Commerce, and rapid deployment of the Navy, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and drastically cuts shipping times to U.S. ports.\" \"We’re not going to stand for it,\" he said. \"So, to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly.\" Breanne Deppisch is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the 2024 election and other national news."

        "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/costly-carol-12-days-christmas-gifting-sees-overall-increase-2024",
        "content": "Museum of the Bible CEO Dr. Carlos Campo joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the holidays at Museum of the Bible. The traditional English carol \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" has long been a favorite during the holiday season, standing the test of time through the centuries and inspiring amusing parodies like Bob Rivers' \"Twelve Pains of Christmas.\" But the song – which counts up from Christmas to Epiphany on Jan. 6 – has also become the peg for a whimsical way to gauge year-over-year inflation. Pennsylvania-based PNC Bank and other financial institutions have tracked the costs of each set of gifts from \"Twelve Drummers Drumming\" to a \"Partridge in a Pear Tree\" to see exactly how much it might cost a man to deliver each to his true love. PNC’s Christmas Price Indexindicated the overall cost of the song’s gifts increased 5.4% since 2023, totaling just under $50,000. Meanwhile, the Texas-based business company Swyft Filings noted in 2023 that costs would also vary depending on each state. Taxes, regulations and other factors would be the most likely variables. The company found California, Hawaii and Washington to be the most expensive and Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama to be the least expensive, given that variation. THE COST OF CHRISTMAS A DECADE AGO Laurie McAdam's color illustration of a partridge in a pear tree. (The Modesto Bee/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Here's a breakdown of the costs counting down from the 12th day. 12 Drummers Drumming PNC Bank cited wage inflation as the driving factor behind the increase in renting a 12-piece drum corps this year. Their estimated cost was $4,017; an increase of 15.6% over 2023. Several websites estimated the average cost of a drummer for two hours was between $250 and $500, depending on the set. Taking the median of that rate and multiplying by a dozen drummers places the cost around $4,500, plus gratuity, of course. 11 Pipers Piping Eleven flutists, or hiring an 11-piece wind ensemble, bear a similar cost-per-head as drummers. In that regard, PNC Bank estimated the same 15.6% increase as the dozen drummers, with a final cost of $3,715. 10 Lords-a-Leaping In the British political system, a lord is a title of peerage or nobility dating back to feudal England, and the House of Lords is the current name for the upper chamberof Parliament. Placing the phrase in an American context, it remains illegal to physically or proverbially purchase a senator for any purpose including leaping, and public corruption has often been a topic in the media. However, some estimates have been published on what the cost would be to pay 10 senators or lords to jump. PNC reported 10 lords-a-leaping would be the most expensive purchase of the 12, with an estimated 2024 cost of $15,579.65 – an increase of 7.2% since 2023. Nine Ladies Dancing According to the website GigSalad, the average cost of a dance troupe for a 30-minute performance is between $200 and $400. The freelancing platform UpWork listed dancers for hire ranging from $30 per hour to more than $100 per hour. The median cost per dancer per hour multiplied by nine comes out to $405 for a half-hour. In PNC’s tracking, nine ladies dancing in the form of a professional troupe would cost $8,557 for an undisclosed set time, up 3% in the past year. Eight Maids-a-Milking Milk prices are back on the upswing in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In November, the average price-per-gallon of whole milk was $4.14, an increase from a flat $4 that time last year. The ubiquitous beverage saw a spike during COVID and settled in the two years since, but is on the increase once more. Dairy cows(Getty) Adding milkmaids to the equation, PNC Bank estimated a cost of $58, unchanged from 2023. Seven Swans-a-Swimming One Midwest swan farm listed the price-per-bird at $400. In 2020, the city of Lakeland, Florida, was dealing with an overpopulation of about 80 swans on a lake in the community outside Tampa. The going price then was also $400, according to CNN. Listings on BirdsNow ranged from $400 to $2500, with a pair being markedly more expensive than two individuals. Altogether, PNC estimated the total cost to exceed $13,000, with no increase over 2023. Six Geese-a-laying While a South Dakota goose farm listed the price of an 8- to 10-pound goose for consumption at $140 each – calculating to $8,400 for a half-dozen, the cost of live geese that can lay eggs was different. Prices for live goslings averaged $40 each online, or $240 for six. PNC’s Christmas index, however, calculated the full cost at $900, or 15% higher than 2023. Five Gold Rings On Monday,gold futureshovered around $2,600 per ounce. While PNC estimated the total cost of five gold rings to be $1,245, the actual value may vary depending on the carats, size of ring and other factors. AMERICAN-MADE PRODUCTS YOU CAN SHOP FOR THIS HOLIDAY SEASON FOR LOVED ONES Gold rings at a fair in Lower Saxony, Germany.(Getty) Four Calling Birds There is some debate over whether the original lyric is really \"four colly birds\" versus \"four calling birds.\" A colly bird is a blackbird in English vernacular. The term \"colly\" has its roots in how something looks when blackened by coal dust. The cost of a live blackbird is between $150 and $225, and PNC estimates four to cost just under $600 – which indicates the lower end of that price spectrum. The bank estimated the cost remained unchanged since 2023. Three French Hens The French Bresse hen is considered one of the most sought-after chickens in the world. Butchers in Paris were selling French hens for €40 per kilo or about $92 per pound. Live poults purchased from farms in the United States ranged from a few dollars up to about $250 as of Monday. In PNC’s index, the cost of three French hens increased 5% from 2023 to about $347. Two Turtledoves In 1992’s\"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,\"Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin McCallister visits \"Duncan’s Toy Chest\" – a play on Manhattan’s iconic FAO Schwarz department store. The elderly owner, played by Eddie Bracken, offers Kevin any one of his store’s Christmas tree’s ornaments. Mr. Duncan tells Kevin he should keep one turtledove and give the second to \"a very special person.\" \"Turtledoves are a symbol of friendship and love,\" he explains. \"As long as you each have a turtledove, you’ll be friends forever.\" Kevin ultimately gives the second turtledove to Brenda Fricker’s \"Pigeon Lady\" at the end of the film after she helps capture the movie's villains, Daniel Stern’s Marv and Joe Pesci’s Harry. TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS EVE ON FOX NATION While that cinematic pair may have been priceless, PNC’s index placed the price of a pair at $750, and European turtledoves themselves are considered a threatened species. And a Partridge in a Pear Tree The Home Depot listed Bartlett pear trees at about $58 this week. Additionally, in an American context, Alaska’s state bird – the Willow Ptarmigan – is a more common type of western partridge. \"Huns\" or Hungarian gray partridges were also introduced in the Lower 48’s northwest in the early 20th century. Costs of both live ptarmigan and ptarmigan meat were unavailable on Monday, but PNC estimated the combined cost as $160. The bank reported the cost of the bird remained the same, but the pear tree increased in price since 2023. In its reporting on its own estimations, PNC officials said on the bank’s website that the internet has made the calculation and potential availability of the items in the ancient English carol much more accessible in the 40 years it has calculated their costs. \"Believe it or not, we're still seeing the cause and effect of the pandemic-inflation hangover, even nearly five years later,\" PNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati said in a statement. A Willow Ptarmigan partridge, Alaska's state bird, in Denali National Park.(Getty) \"With years of steep price increases, we'd think inflation has nowhere to go, but we'd be wrong. This latest PNC CPI is an accurate reflection of what we're seeing in the market.\" Online purchases of the lyrical items were calculated to be more expensive online than at a brick-and-mortar store due to shipping costs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The overall cost of the 12 Days of Christmas increased 133% in the past four decades, with factors such asminimum wage increasesparticularly affecting the for-hire gifts such as pipers and drummers. If an enterprising fellow were to purchase his beau the song's 364 total gifts from the 12-day giving spree, it would rise from 2023 by 3.6% to an estimated cost of $209,272.

President-elect Donald Trumpis being urged to step in as House Republicans face pressure to elect the next speaker quickly despite a handful of party members posing a threat to the razor-thin majority, leaving House Speaker Mike Johnson's, R-La., control of the gavel – and potentially the fate of the election certification – hanging in the balance. \"It's a terrible challenge. We've seen it play out over the past two years. It was very difficult for Kevin McCarthy. It's been very difficult for Mike Johnson. It would be very difficult for whomever would be elected speaker of our conference,\" Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., told Fox News on Sunday. \"But at the end of the day, the difference between the 119th Congress and the 118th Congress is we'll have a Republican president, a strong Republican president who's very popular with Republican congressmen, constituents back home, and that's Donald Trump,\" he continued.

A fierySouth Korean plane crashwidely credited to failed landing gear has invited a flurry of speculation, including whether something more came into play leading up to the disaster. \"There are a million backups on this airplane. It's extremely safe, and that's what a lot of people are saying. They can't understand why this airplane was landed on that runway at that speed with no flaps, with no gear. There might have been something else involved,\" aviation consultant Mike Boyd told Fox News Sunday. \"A bird strike on an engine might shut an engine down, but there's so many redundant systems there, it just doesn't make sense. We're not in the dark, but we know the runway is 9,200 feet. It's a very long runway. It [the plane] did come in hot and high, hot and fast. We don't know why that was the real issue.\" Eyewitnesses to the crashthat killed 179 people said they observed flames in the aircraft's engine and heard explosions, reports say. One described seeing a \"flash of light\" followed by smoke. Another said the plane was unable to land in the initial attempt and had to circle back around to try again before the crash occurred.

We don't know, but it's very strange to have that airplane land that hot on a runway where it literally was still going pretty strong when they hit that wall.\" The Jeju Air flight skidded off the runway and crashed into a concrete fence at Muan International Airport in Muan, South Korea, roughly 190 miles south of Seoul, on Sunday, leaving only two survivors out of 181 onboard.

However, Vance's skillful showings in combative interviews soon earned him a reputation as one of Trump's best surrogates, and he was also widely considered the winner of the only vice-presidential debate with Democratic counterpart Tim Walz. Less than three years ago, Vance was part of a crowded field of contenders for the Ohio Republican Senate nomination. He went on to win the primary, defeat Democrat Tim Ryan and then join Trump's successful White House ticket in one of the quickest rises in political history. Vance, 40, will be the third-youngest vice president in American history when he is sworn in next month.

Six states, including one with a Democratic governor, have either banned or prohibited the use of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiativesin public colleges and universitiesthis year. The practice of DEI in higher educational institutions has been controversial for several years, most frequentlyopposed by Republicansand described by critics, such as civil rights attorney Devon Westhill, as an \"industry that pushes a left-wing, far-left ideological orthodoxy in essentially every area of American life.\" In 2024 alone, Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas and Utah either banned or limited the use of such teaching or use in the application process in their state's education system. In January, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, signed legislation to prohibit institutions from engaging in \"discriminatory practices\" such as \"that an individual, by virtue of the individual’s personal identity characteristics, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other individuals with the same personal identity characteristics.\" INDIANA UNIVERSITY COURSE TEACHES PEOPLE ARE INHERENTLY ‘OPPRESSORS’ BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE, SEX, RELIGION The University of Utah campus is viewed from Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, Utah.(Rick Bowmer) The anti-DEI law also banned schools from having any policy, procedure, practice, program, office, initiative, or required training that is referred to or called \"diversity, equity and inclusion.\" In March, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama signed SB 129 into law. It prohibits certain DEI offices, as well as the \"promotion, endorsement, and affirmation of certain divisive concepts in certain public settings.\" The bill bans \"divisive concepts,\" such as \"that any individual should accept, acknowledge, affirm, or assent to a sense of guilt, complicity, or a need to apologize on the basis of his or her race, color, religion, sex, ethnicity, or national origin\" and \"that meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist.\" The legislation also required that restrooms be used on the basis of biological sex rather than gender identity, and that public institutions of higher education \"authorize certain penalties for violation.\" Gov. Kay Ivey takes questions from reporters during a press conference at the Alabama State Capitol Building in Montgomery, Ala.(Reuters) Also in March,Indiana adopted legislationto amend the duties of state educational institutions' diversity committees and increase \"intellectual diversity.\" Additionally, the Indiana House introduced legislation to further prohibit DEI teachings in schools by mandating that educators \"shall not promote in any course certain concepts related to race or sex.\" BIDEN EDUCATION DEPARTMENT SPENT OVER $1 BILLION ON DEI GRANTS: REPORT Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, allowed legislation prohibiting postsecondary educational institutions from engaging in certain DEI-related actions to become law without her signature.

        "content": "Presidential historian Jane Hampton Cook reflects on the professional and personal life of America’s 39th president after his death at 100 years old. After thepassing of 100-year-old former President Jimmy Carter, many are recalling the \"killer rabbit\" incident in which Carter had to fight off a berserk swamp creature while fishing in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. The bizarre incident occurred in April 1979 but was not known to the public until months later when, according to an account by then White House Press Secretary Jody Powell, the press official shared the story with reporter Brooks Jackson. After the story broke, it captured the American imagination and came to be seen as emblematic of theCarter presidency, which many perceived as ineffective and flailing. Sensationalized headlines ran across the country such as the Washington Post’s \"Bunny Goes Bugs. Rabbit Attacks President\" and the New York Times’s \"A Tale of Carter and the ‘Killer Rabbit.’\" TRIBUTES POUR IN FROM CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS AFTER JIMMY CARTER'S DEATH: 'A GREAT HUMANITARIAN' Former President Jimmy Carter discusses his cancer diagnosis during a press conference at the Carter Center on August 20, 2015, in Atlanta, Georgia.(Jessica McGowan/Getty Images) The story, which is backed by a photograph taken by a White House staffer, goes that Carter, while fishing near Plains, suddenly noticed a large swamp rabbit swimming quickly toward him. Powell said that \"this large, wet animal, making strange hissing noises and gnashing its teeth, was intent upon climbing into the Presidential boat.\" Carter used a paddle to splash water at the creature, causing it to change course and swim away. The New York Timesreported in August 1979 that the rabbit had \"penetrated Secret Service security and attacked President Carter,\" forcing him to \"beat back the animal with a canoe paddle.\" The outlet reported one White House staffer saying, \"the President was swinging for his life.\" The picture, which was not released by the White House until after Carter lost his re-election effort toRonald Reaganin 1980, shows the now-deceased president splashing water as a large rabbit, its ears poking out of the water, swims away.

The deceased president said: \"A rabbit was being chased by hounds and he jumped in the water and swam toward my boat. When he got almost there, I splashed some water with a paddle and the rabbit turned and went on and crawled out on the other side.\" However, that did not stop national and local media outlets from running the story about the \"killer rabbit\" far and wide. In 1979, Carter was in the middle of his one-term presidency. He was facing several difficulties both at home and abroad, including an energy crisis and economic issues and the Iran hostage crisis. Amid these troubles, Carter’s approval ratings took a dramatic dip, and he reached some of the highest disapproval numbers of his entire presidency.

Library of Congress/Marion S. Trikosko/Handout via Reuters. While newspaper accounts of the \"banzai bunny\" and cartoons of giant, bucktoothed rabbits were clearly fanciful, many came to see the whole story as a sort of metaphor for Carter’s struggling presidency. Powell, who originally thought of the incident as an innocent, comical story, later said he had come to regret his decision to share it with the press because of the way it was used to portray the president as so weak and inept that he was even afraid of a bunny. Powell described the events as a \"nightmare\" in his 1985 memoir \"The Other Side of the Story.\" \"It still makes my flesh crawl to think I could have been so foolish, I thought it was funny,\" he wrote. \"Had I been doing my job, I would have stopped the President at that moment, pointed out the dangers to him and his administration if such a story ever got out. . . .

Members of the U.S. intelligence community who believed that the coronavirus may have originated from a lab leak in China were blocked from sharing their opinions and research with the broader intel community, according to sources inside the FBI and other government officials familiar with the Biden administration's internal efforts during the pandemic. In the first few months after COVID arrived in the U.S., the prevailing view within the Biden administration was that COVID-19 most likely originated organically in Wuhan, China, and was transferred to humans from infected animals. They said this was potentially due to the country's under-regulated and extensive wildlife trade. This viewpoint was opposed by a much smaller group within the intel community, who believed a purposeful or accidental lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the likely cause of the outbreak. Now, it has come to light in a newWall Street Journal reportthat some of those officials who believed in the likelihood of a COVID-19 lab-leak theory were reportedly blocked by the Biden administration from sharing their viewpoints with the president and otherintelligence community leaders. Early inJoe Biden'spresidency, he tasked the U.S. intelligence community with preparing a report on their most updated analysis on the origins of the coronavirus.

Yet, according toFBIsenior scientist Jason Bannan, who was tasked with helping lead the agency's investigation into COVID-19's origins, neither he nor any of his agency counterparts were invited to share their assessment during an August 2021 briefing with the president, led by the White House's National Intelligence Council, that sought to share the intel community's position on natural versus artificial origins of COVID-19. \"Being the only agency that assessed that a laboratory origin was more likely, and the agency that expressed the highest level of confidence in its analysis of the source of the pandemic, we anticipated the FBI would be asked to attend the briefing,\" Bannan told the Wall Street Journal. \"I find it surprising that the White House didn’t ask.\" Additionally, according to sources familiar with the matter, three scientists at the National Center for Medical Intelligence, a sub-agency within the Department of Defense's Defense Intelligence Agency, were also blocked from sharing their research that concluded the coronavirus originated from a lab leak. Ultimately, a Defense Intelligence Agency Inspector General report was commissioned to find out whether the three scientists' assessment was suppressed. Coronavirus molecule, March 24, 2020. A spokesperson for the ODNI declined to comment on the report, which has yet to be released. FAUCI DENIES SEEKING TO SUPPRESS COVID-19 LAB LEAK ORIGIN THEORY The three scientists at the National Center for Medical Intelligence, John Hardham, Robert Cutlip and Jean-Paul Chretien, argued that evidence they found had shown that Chinese scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were conducting dangerous \"gain-of-function\" research. In turn, the trio informed their counterparts, including someone at the FBI on Bannan's team, about their findings. However, in July 2021, the three scientists were told by their superiors to halt any continued sharing of their work with people at the FBI, which they were told was \"off the reservation,\" the Wall Street Journal reported.

Kentucky’s legislature is primed to consider a bill in the new year that would make parents responsible for their juvenile child committing a crime involving thedischarge of a firearm. State Rep. Kim Banta, R-Erlanger, modeled her legislation after similar laws that hold parents accountable for property crimes and motor vehicle accidents. In the Bluegrass State, parents are liable for up to $2,500 in cases where their kids deface property and the guardian who signed a minor’s driver's license application is \"jointly and severally liable\" for any findings of negligence or damage behind the wheel. \"The most important thing is that I am absolutely not trying to stop gun sales or enact gun control,\" Banta told Fox News Digital in a Friday interview. BIDEN TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER AIMED AT REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE A sign on US-460 leaving Virginia greets drivers near Mouthcard, Ky., in 2017 (Charles Creitz) \"I'm simply trying to make parents aware that whether it is driving a car or doing anything else their child does, they need to know what they’re doing, and they need to exercise caution.\" Similar to the language in the car-crash law, Banta’s bill imputes \"negligence or willful misconduct\" of a minor on their parents/guardians for civil damages stemming from injuries to another person that are causedby a person with a gun. Factors in determining parental liability include whether the elder allowed the child to have the gun, was aware of previous gun law violations or believes the minor to have the propensity to be violent, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. On Friday, Banta said there had been a recent case in Kentucky where several 15-year-olds got into a disagreement, purportedly over drugs, and one boy went home, retrieved a gun, and came back and shot the two other youths.

        "content": "More than 20 years later, the system is getting a makeover. Smart home cameras have become a necessity. You already know they help keep an eye on what’s happening indoors and outdoors, even when you’re not home. But while these cameras are undeniably useful, they also pose aprivacy risk. A new study highlights outdoor security camera apps as some of the biggest collectors of user data. This includes sensitive personal information like email addresses, phone numbers, payment details, precise location and more. GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE Smart outdoor camera(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) According to astudy conducted by Surfshark, outdoor security camera apps are some of the top offenders when it comes to collecting user data. These apps gather 12 data points on average, including sensitive details like email addresses, phone numbers, payment information and precise location. That’s 50% more than what other smart home devices typically collect. What’s even worse is that these apps often connect up to seven of these data points directly to your identity. Indoor securitycamera appsare slightly less data-hungry but still raise privacy concerns. They collect an average of nine data points, with six typically tied to users' identities. Commonly collected data includes email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, device IDs, purchase histories and audio data. While this information can help improve the user experience, it also increases the risk of privacy violations. One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn’t actually necessary for the apps to do their job. Smart camera(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC Among the apps that collect the most data, Deep Sentinel and Lorex stand out for outdoorsecurity cameras, each collecting 18 out of a possible 32 data points. Nest Labs, which leads the pack for indoor cameras, collects 17 data points, with Ring and Arlo each gathering 15. The absence of regulations and standards for smart home devices creates significant privacy risks. Without clear guidelines, users are vulnerable to data breaches, cyberattacks and even physical harm. Some apps track users for targeted ads or share data with third parties and data brokers. While outdoor security cameras typically avoid tracking, indoor cameras like Nooie and Canary Connect engage in user tracking, further complicating privacy concerns. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Smart indoor camera(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH 1. Limit data sharing:Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information. 2. Regularly review and update privacy settings:Smart home cameras often receive software updates that may change privacy settings. It’s important to regularly review the app’s privacy settings to make sure they align with your preferences. Disable features that aren’t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers. 3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA):Make sure your camera’s app and associated accounts are protected by strong, unique passwords. Consider using apassword managerto generate and store complex passwords. 4. Enabletwo-factor authentication(2FA) wherever possible:This adds an extra layer of security in case your account information is compromised. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE 5. Be mindful of camera placement:If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture. 6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it’s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach. 7. Use a VPN:Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using aVPN (Virtual Private Network) servicecan enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don’t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on yourWindows, Mac, Android & iOS devices 8. Regularly review privacy policies:Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information. 9. Considerhome security systemswith enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps: By actively managing these settings and using a VPN, you can significantly reduce your exposure to potential privacy risks associated with your smart home system. Check outmy picks for best security systems. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET The rapid rise of IoT tech has changed the way we live and interact. But without proper rules in place, companies might put profits over user safety. This can lead to devices with security holes and weaknesses. A lot of smart home cameras are collecting more data than they really need and aren't clear about what they’re doing with it. It could be sold to third-party companies or used to target you with ads.

        "headline": "Stuck behind a VPN wall? Let’s find a way around it",
        "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/stuck-behind-vpn-wall-lets-find-way-around",
        "content": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy. A virtual private network (VPN) is a useful tool that allows you to mask your IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. This means you can browse the web more privately, especially when connected to apublic Wi-Fi network. Another use case for VPNs is accessing sites that are blocked in your region. For example, you could be sitting in New York and accessing content on Chinese social media platforms (though I wouldn’t recommend doing that). However, a VPN can sometimes have the opposite effect, blocking you from accessing content that you were otherwise able to view. I recently received an email from Carol in Douglasville, Georgia, who asked: \"Why am I blocked from seeing a site when I use a VPN? I am being blocked from answering emails I receive from the VA, Social Security and government sites that I need to connect to concerning my benefits.\" She says she attempted changing servers and even switched to different citieswithin the U.S., but she still couldn’t access the sites. Carol, that sounds like a serious issue. Understandably, you would want to use a VPN when visiting websites, and not being able to access them can be quite frustrating. This situation may even force you to disable your VPN, which could put you at risk. Below, I’ll discuss why this happens and how you can work around the issue. GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER — THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE A VPN on a smartphone.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Avirtual private network (VPN)is a secure connection method used to add privacy and security to private and public networks, like the internet and Wi-Fi hotspots. VPNs are often used to protect sensitive data and to ensure that online activities are safe from cyber threats. By encrypting your internet traffic and masking your online identity, a VPN provides anonymity and protects against hackers, snoopers and data breaches. It also allows you to access content that may be restricted based on your geographic location, making it a great tool for boosting your online privacy and freedom.Here are 10 reasons you need a VPN at home. Website owners can decide who gets to access their sites and who doesn’t. Many sites block IPs from known VPNs or data centers, especially if their content is restricted to certain countries or regions. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Big platforms like Netflix or banking sites often useVPN detectiontools to prevent people from accessing their services anonymously. Government websites do this, too, mostly to prevent people from bypassing regional or national restrictions. For instance, in countries with strict content rules, blocking VPNs helps prevent people from accessing content the government doesn't want them to see. But even setting your VPN to a different location in the same country doesn’t always work. Why? Because some sites are trying to keep cybercriminals out. VPNs can hide your identity and location, which is great for privacy but can also be misused for fraud. Government websites dealing with things like taxes, voting or benefits need to verify who you are and where you’re logging in from to prevent misuse. Allowing VPNs could make it easier for fraudsters to slip through. Another reason for blocking VPNs is to keep bots at bay. Bots can use VPNs to scrape government websites or overload their systems. Blocking VPN traffic helps protect sensitive information and makes it easier to trace and authenticate real users. A VPN being used on a laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO USE VPNS WITHOUT COMPROMISING YOUR BANKING APPS If you're having trouble accessing certain sites with your VPN on, try the steps below. Start from the first step and keep going until the issue is resolved. Using a reliable VPN service is one of the best ways to work around VPN blocks. Not all VPNs are created equal, and choosing a high-quality provider can make a significant difference. Look for a VPN that offers obfuscated or \"stealth\" servers, which disguise VPN traffic to appear as regular internet usage, making it harder for detection systems to block you. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE A good VPN should also have a large server network with plenty of options across different locations so you can easily switch if one server is blocked. Some services even offer dedicated IP addresses, which are less likely to be flagged compared to shared ones.For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on yourWindows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. A woman using a VPN on her cellphone.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOTSPOT PRIVACY AND SECURITY WITH A VPN If one server isn’t working, try connecting to another in the same country or region. VPN providers usually have multiple servers, and switching might help you bypass the block. If this doesn’t work, use obfuscated servers. These servers are designed to hide the fact that you’re using a VPN. They can bypass strict VPN detection systems, especially on government or streaming websites. To bypass VPN blocks, you can change the connection protocol your device uses. VPN protocols determine how devices link to servers, and some protocols are more adept at evading detection than others. If you're facing issues accessing specific websites, switching to a different protocol may help. For instance, some protocols offer a good balance of speed and security, while others prioritize faster performance or efficiency, potentially improving your ability to bypass restrictions. For more detailed information, it's important to research which protocols are best suited for specific use cases, as the effectiveness of different protocols can vary. WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME? If you only need the VPN for certain apps or websites, enable split tunneling in your VPN settings. This lets you access blocked sites using your regular connection while keeping the VPN active for other purposes. For example, you can enable split tunneling to watch a movie on Netflix using your regular internet connection while keeping your banking app secure with the VPN. Not all VPNs are created equal. Some are better at bypassing blocks than others. If your current VPN isn’t working, consider switching to one that specializes in evading detection. If all else fails, switch to a mobile data connection or a different network. Sometimes, the issue is with your current ISP (internet service provider) rather than the VPN. 30% OF AMERICANS OVER 65 WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WEB. HERE’S WHY VPNs are great for getting around restrictions, but some websites have blockers to stop VPN traffic. There are a few ways to get around these blockers, and sometimes, it's just as easy as switching servers. You’ll have the best chance of getting your VPN unblocked if you're using a reliable service. They keep an eye on their servers to make sure everything’s running smoothly and offer extra features like dedicated IP addresses.

        "content": "Retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula provides his assessment on the conflict in Ukraine and the U.S.'s approach to the Houthis and Iran. Russian PresidentVladimir Putin seemingly took a page out of President Biden’s book and is offering to write off debts for new recruits enlisting in the country’s military for one year. In November, Putin signed a law allowing anyone who joined the Russian military after Dec. 1, 2024, to have debs of up to 10 million rubles, or about $96,000, written off. The Associated Press reported that the law applies to debts in which a court order for collection was issued, and enforcement proceedings had commenced before Dec. 1, 2024. The legislation also applies to spouses of new recruits. The move appears to be similar to one from Biden’s own playbook, though the latter does not connect loan handouts to military recruitment.

The massive handout will give 54,900 public workers loan forgiveness but also brings the total loan forgiveness approved by Biden to nearly $180 billion for nearly 5 million borrowers. The Biden-Harris administration touted the program for creating an \"incentive\" for public servants to \"pursue and remain\" in their careers by forgiving borrowers' remaining balance after they made the 120 qualifying monthly payments.

The AP reported on Sunday that western leaders say North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to help Russia’s military campaign.

Israeli spy agencies have uncovered information about Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr's plans to marry his four mistresses over the phone, according to a report. The New York Timesreported this weekabout its investigation into how deeply Israeli spies had penetrated Hezbollah leading up to the assassination of its top leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as other commanders in the Iran-backed terror group. Israel announced in July that its forces hadkilled Shukurduring what was, at the time, a rare and provacative strike in Beirut. It came in response to Israel assessing that the Hezbollah commander was behind the rocket attack days earlier in the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 people, including schoolchildren.

Shukr – apparently uneasy about his affairs – earlier this year reached out for help from Hashem Safieddine, one of Hezbollah’s highest religious clerics, to have the four women wedded, two Israeli officials and a European official told the Times. Safieddine, in turn, reportedly arranged four marriage ceremonies conducted over the phone. The intimate and sometimes mundane details of Shukr's personal affairs point to how closely Israeli intelligence agencies managed to track the moves of Hezbollah's leadership.

        "content": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT. Syria's Bashar Assad has been accused of extreme torture and murder within his prison system. (Getty Images, Reuters, AP) In the shadow ofSyria’s brutal civil war, one institution stands as a chilling symbol of the regime’s systemic violence: Sednaya prison. Referred to as the \"Death Factory\" or the \"Human Slaughterhouse,\" Sednaya became a site of unimaginable suffering. Around 100,000 individuals, according to reports, have disappeared into Assad'a prisons, where people, including thousands of women and children, were detained, tortured and killed. \"Rights groups have documented that at least 10% of those detained lost their lives in these prisons, though some reports suggest the figure could be as high as 20%,\" said Joseph Braude, founder of the Center for Peace Communications, an NGO dedicated to resolving identity-based conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, whose group gained rare access to Sednaya. \"The number continues to rise as families speak out about the whereabouts of theirmissing loved ones, many of whom remain unaccounted for.\" SYRIA'S LIBERATED POLITICAL PRISONS REVEAL GRIM REALITY OF BASHAR ASSAD'S REGIME OF TORTURE A bloodied noose at a recently liberated prison in Syria.(Reuters) Sednaya was not just a prison, it was a tool to crush any form of resistance or humanity. \"The prison was located on a hill outside Damascus,\" Ahed Al Hendi, a former political prisoner and Syrian affairs analyst, told Fox News Digital. \"We would see it while going to a nearby tourist area, but even if you were just driving by, you were afraid to talk about it. If you said, ‘Sednaya,’ you would end up there.\" Al Hendi continued: \"I’ve heard from my friends describing the sights going into Sednaya this week. They found bags of bones, there was still fresh blood on the floor, the smell of death, and the torture machines, which were the most horrible things they’ve seen. One friend told me he saw a mother hugging the torture machine, believing her son had died there. It was a tragic image, seeing her holding the machine that killed her son, thinking she could still smell him in the machine. The tools were unimaginable, like a massive metal press designed to liquefy bodies and make them unrecognizable.\" As Assad regime’satrocities at Sednaya become clearer, and after days of looking for survivors and realizing that some people may never be found, attention has shifted to mass graves. Braude’s team on the ground in Syria is currently collecting evidence. \"We're documenting, we're interviewing people who are there, trying to use equipment to discover any possibility of secret underground prisons.\" He said the team had recently worked at a mass grave site \"where we estimate 100,000 people were buried.\" \"Some of the people in these mass graves came from Sednaya and died under torture,\" Al Hendi said. \"Many show gunshot wounds, and their bodies were moved to a large area where the regime placed old military equipment to create the illusion of a restricted military zone. Locals reported seeing refrigerated trucks entering the area with security forces blocking the roads. The trucks stayed for hours before leaving.

We found children born there as a result of rape by prison guards. Entire families were destroyed by the regime.\" The conditions in Sednaya were inhumane. Prisoners were often starved, beaten and tortured with electricity. \"When they execute someone, they don’t feed them for three days before the execution. The guards say, ‘Why feed him? We will take the food for ourselves.’ Imagine someone about to die, and they are starved first, denied even the dignity of a last meal,\" Al Hendi said.

Both Braude and Al Hendi emphasize the need for accountability. \"What we need now is truth and reconciliation,\" Braude says. \"Only by acknowledging the suffering and recognizing the full scope of the atrocities can Syria begin to heal. If we don’t do that, we risk perpetuating cycles of vengeance.\" After the fall of the Assad regime earlier this month, Sednaya was liberated, and thousands of prisoners were freed. \"The prisoners who emerged from Sednaya were traumatized, many of them unable to even remember their own names,\" Al Hendi said. \"They had been detained for so long they didn’t even know that Assad’s father had died.

Each day we fail to do so, we risk losing the chance for comprehensive accountability.\" The investigations into Sednaya and the mass graves have painted a horrific picture of the regime’s violence, but they also serve as a call for justice, Braude said. \"The consequences of the Assad regime’s atrocities are profound. The key question now is how the population canmove forward and rebuild, rather than descending into further civil conflict. There is a fear of cycles of vengeance, but true reconciliation can only come through truth and acknowledgment.\" He said that \"99% of Syria’s prison guards belong to the Alawi community.\" \"We’re talking about half the young population of the Alawi sect, as most of them work in the army or secret police.

Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation. \"The NTSB is leading a team of U.S. investigators (NTSB, Boeing and FAA) to assist the Republic of Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) with their investigation of the Dec. 29 Jeju Air accident at Muan International Airport in Muan, Republic of Korea,\" the NTSB Newsroom account wrote on X. Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport’s localizer — a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings — should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa. Sunday's crash, the country’s worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments ofPresident Yoon Suk Yeoland Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon’s brief imposition of martial law earlier this month. New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country’s aircraft operation systems. \"The essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\" Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister, said, according to the Associated Press.

Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball. The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33, according to the AP. Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families. \"I demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\" he said, choking down tears. Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul’s Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure. South Korean national flags fly at half-mast at the government complex in Seoul, South Korea, on Monday, Dec. 30, 2024.(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) Joo said officials were reviewing whether there might have been communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot. \"Our current understanding is that, at some point during the go-around process, communication became somewhat ineffective or was interrupted, ahead of the landing and impact,\" he said. Ministry officials said Monday the plane’s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash. The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board. The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-daynational mourning periodthrough Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people. Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida, told the AP. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said. Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They told the AP there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

        "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/what-jimmy-carter-can-teach-us-about-life-our-legacy",
        "content": "Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume reacts to the passing of former President Jimmy Carter on ‘Fox News Live.’ National mourning is a time for remembrance and reflection and gives us the freedom to do so through a lens of patriotism, not politics – and from a posture of gratitude, not partisanship. This is where we are today as the nation learns of the passing of our 39th President,Jimmy Carter. Though many on the right have criticized Jimmy Carter’s policies, we can still recognize and celebrate his willingness to step up and engage in public service to our nation through his military career as a naval officer and his political career as governor andstate senator from Georgia, as well as president of the United States. We should also acknowledge the humanity behind this loss. Not only is America saying goodbye to a president, but behind the protocol and pageantry, the Carters are saying goodbye to a father, a grandfather, an uncle, and a friend to many who knew him personally. This must be an especially difficult time for the Carter family as they said goodbye to Rosalynn in November of last year. The former first lady had been diagnosed with dementia and entered hospice care just two days prior to her passing. Surprisingly, President Carter entered hospice care in February 2023, but outlived his wife by more than a year. The Carters were married for 77 years – the longest presidential marriage in American history. They will be buried side by side on their property in Plains, Georgia, where they lived for more than 60 years. JIMMY CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DEAD AT 100 Though he was best known as president, Carter was most comfortable at home in Plains, rather than on the world stage. He lived a life which was simple, modest, and humble. He was deeply committed to faith, to family, and to living a life in service to others. He was actively involved in his church, teaching Sunday School, and immersing himself in both the Word of God, as well as the work of God here on earth. Some may be conflicted about how they think of Jimmy Carter upon his passing, and that is OK. Life is complicated and people are complex. No one’s life can be placed entirely on one side of a Good or Bad ledger. Thankfully so -- for all of us. We can celebrate a selfless life devoted to others, and let history be the judge of Jimmy Carter’s final legacy. Our legacies are not written after we are gone but are written with every day of our lives. He remained invested in global issues surrounding world peace and election integrity, often traveling to foreign countries to represent this passion. Yet Carter was most at ease in blue jeans, swinging a hammer alongside volunteers with Habitat for Humanity, building homes for those in need. DOUG SCHOEN: JIMMY CARTER PROVIDED A MODEL FOR THE POST-PRESIDENCY While he could have retired long ago and rested on his laurels of accomplishment, Carter chose to continue to use his platform and notoriety to bless others, doing so with his words, as well as his actions. In many ways he embodied the American spirit of generosity, selflessness, voluntarism, and reflected the true heart of America, which is abundantly found in small towns like Plains which dot this great nation. In October 1986, when Carter’s presidential successor, Ronald Reagan, spoke at the dedication ceremony for the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta, Reagan said,\"None of us today need feel any urge, in the name of good will, to downplay our differences. On the contrary, in a certain sense, we can be proud of our differences, because they arise from good will itself -- from love of country; for concern for the challenges of our time; from respect for, and yes, even outright enjoyment of, the democratic processes of disagreement and debate. Today our very differences attest to the greatness of our nation. For I can think of no other country on Earth where two political leaders could disagree so widely yet come together in mutual respect.\" Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter attends the starting day of the 24th Jimmy Carter Work Project in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 29, 2007.(Mario Anzuoni/File Photo) Amidst their differences, Reagan preferred to focus on areas of commonality with Jimmy Carter, and we would be wise to do the same. Indeed, there were many things on which we did agree – a love of country,love of God, love of service, love of the land, the value of life, the importance of peace and democratic elections, and the desire to eradicate disease worldwide. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The story of Jimmy Carter’s presidency has already been recorded for posterity – both the highs and the lows. Historians will ultimately determine his place and impact in the annals of history. Some of it will not be flattering. While he was alive, Carter himself knew what was being said about the malaise and decline of America under his leadership. He knew what would be said after he was gone too. Perhaps that’s why he worked so hard to create another aspect of his legacy after leaving the White House. It may actually be his later years which were most meaningful and will be most remembered. Everyone has chapters of their life they are proud of – and some they are not. It is up to each of us to be active participants in the writing of our own legacies. Our legacies are not written after we are gone but are written with every day of our lives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Much of life is handed to us and we are forced to react or respond to it. But for the elements of life we can control, initiate, and prioritize, maybe Jimmy Carter was a great example of a life well lived – in totality – not judged exclusively by its lowest moments, but rather by how it ended. Ultimately, Jimmy Carter left this earth the way he wanted to - simply, humbly, quietly, surrounded by family and friends, secure in God’s love and salvation, having lived a long, full life in service to others. Perhaps, at its core, that’s what it truly means to have lived a great American life.

        "content": "Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier takes a look back at former President Jimmy Carter's life and legacy on 'Fox News Live.' Editor’s note:This essay first appeared on the author’s blog:Res ipsa loquitur – The thing itself speaks America is mourning the loss on Sunday of one of the most genuinely decent men ever to sit in the Oval Office. Even to his critics,Jimmy Carterwas a model of empathy and integrity as an American president. After his presidency, he proved an even greater role model, working tirelessly to help those without homes or hope. He gave us 100 years of a life committed to helping others and a lasting lesson in what it means to be truly a public servant. Both President Joe Biden andPresident-elect Donald Trumpoffered moving tributes to Carter. President Biden spoke to the nation from St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Sunday evening. In his remarks he noted that Carter showed \"what it means to live a life of meaning and purpose, a life of principle, faith and humility.\" He added, \"Some look at Jimmy Carterand see a man of a bygone era with honesty and character. Faith and humility mattered, but I don’t believe it’s a bygone era,\" Biden said. \"We’d all do well to try to be more like Jimmy Carter.\" JIMMY CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DEAD AT 100 President-elect Trump declared \"The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\" After Biden made his remarks about Carter, he took questions from reporters. The media immediately saw the testimonial comments as an opportunity to get a dig on Trump and Biden seemed eager to oblige them. When a reporter asked Biden what President-elect Trump should take from Carter’s legacy, Biden replied: \"Decency, decency, decency. … Can you imagine Jimmy Carter walking by someone who needed something and just keep walking? Can you imagine Jimmy Carter referring to someone by the way they look or the way they talk?\" It was a jarring disconnect from the moment of unity by both presidents. BIDEN TAKES JAB AT TRUMP WHILE APPLAUDING JIMMY CARTER'S DECENCY, SHARES FONDEST MEMORY WITH LATE PRESIDENT It was also a curious choice of presidents for Biden to make the comparison. There is another thing that Carter would not do: pardon a family member in an influence-peddling scandal. Throughout his presidency, Carter was faced with allegations that his brother Billy Carter took $200,000 from a Libyan dictator as a \"loan\" and only paid back $1,000.  There were also allegations of even more money derived from open influence peddling from foreign sources. Sound familiar? DOUG SCHOEN: JIMMY CARTER PROVIDED A MODEL FOR THE POST-PRESIDENCY Indeed, Biden defenders immediately tried to use Carter to deflect criticism from the president after he pardoned his son Hunter byfalsely claimingthat he pardoned Billy. Grant Stern, an editor for the advocacy groupOccupy Democrats,wrote: \"Jimmy Carter pardoned his brother Billy Carter, who took over $200,000 from Libya as its foreign agent. George H.W. Bush pardoned his son Neil Bush for his role in the S&L scandals of the 1980s. Nobody thinks those pardons defined either presidency. Joe Biden’s pardon of Hunter Biden won’t either.\" Neither of those pardons \"defined either presidency\" because neither of those pardons existed. (On ABC, \"The View\" co-host Ana Navarro even claimed various family pardons, including mentioning another president to defend the Hunter Biden pardon: \"Woodrow Wilson pardoned his brother-in-law, Hunter deButts… But tell me again how Joe Biden ‘is setting precedent’?\"Many immediately told herinstead how Wilson did not have a brother-in-law named \"Hunter deButts,\" let alone pardon him). CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In reality, despite lingering questions and investigations, Carter refused to pardon his brother. Instead, he told the American people the truth: \"I am deeply concerned that Billy has received funds from Libya and that he may be under obligation to Libya. These facts will govern my relationship with Billy as long as I am president. Billy has had no influence on U.S. policy or actions concerning Libya in the past, and he will have no influence in the future.\" Unlike Carter, President Biden lied repeatedly to the voters in denying that (1) Hunter had any dealings with the Chinese, (2) he ever met his son’s clients, (3) he knew of any of these dealings, and (4) he would ever pardon his son. He then pardoned Hunter for any and all crimes committed over the last decade, including potential crimes that many believe implicate the president himself in a multimillion dollar influence peddling scheme. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Notably, in seeking a comparative dig at Trump, the reporters did not seek to ask about this point of comparison with Biden. We all knew that, no matter how one felt about Carter’s performance as president, there were some things that he would not do in office. Perhaps that is why \"Some look at Jimmy Carter and see a man of a bygone era with honesty and character.\" They look at Biden himself and say, \"We’d all do well to try to be more like Jimmy Carter.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY Jonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024)."

        "content": "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Trump emphasizing a message of unity and optimism before his second term. There’s no easy way to put it:America’s farmersare in trouble. Our farmers lost more than $30 billion this year. A new Farm Bill to help them is stalled in Congress thanks to Democratic stonewalling. Four years of rising input costs andBiden-led regulatory overreachhave put many family farms on the verge of extinction. The good news is that America is going to have a friend to farmers back in the White House soon. President-elect Trump scored win after win for our farm families during his first term and I know that’s one of his top goals for his second. But as the old saying goes, personnel is policy. Brooke Rollins, the president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, speaks during an event on Jan. 28, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) That’s why we needBrooke Rollins, President Trump’s nominee to serve as secretary of agriculture, to be confirmed as soon as possible. TRUMP TAPS TEXAN BROOKE ROLLINS AS AGRICULTURE SECRETARY I worked with Brooke in the White House, where she and I were part of a group of women empowered by President Trump to fight for his America First vision. As director of the Domestic Policy Council and the Office of American Innovation, Brooke mastered policies across issue areas and helped the president unleash the greatest economy in American history. She worked especially hard to roll back onerous red tape like the Waters of the United States policy, whichPresident Obama wantedto use to regulate every stream, creek and puddle in America. Farming isn’t just intellectual to Brooke. She grew up in a small, agricultural community in Texas and comes from generations of hardworking American farmers. She studied agriculture at Texas A&M and spent the early part of her career fighting to protect farmers’ interests. She was part of 4-H and FFA and raises steer with her four kids. US AGRICULTURE PRIMED TO BE NEXT FRONTIER IN CYBERSECURITY IN NEW YEAR, EXPERTS, LAWMAKERS SAY Not long ago, I joined Sen. John Boozman, Arkansas’ senior senator and the incoming chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, for a tour of farms in the Arkansas Delta. At the end of a long day meeting with farmers, we sat down for a roundtable inMcGehee, Arkansas. I’d known for a while that our farm families were struggling but this event made it crystal clear. One by one, the farmers at the table told me how their neighbors and relatives were dropping out of the agriculture industry and having to scramble to find jobs elsewhere. They talked about how the price of everything from fuel to seeds was going up, but that the price that their row crops fetched in the market wasn’t keeping up. They described it as a generational crisis. President Trump speaks while Brooke Rollins, of the Texas Public Policy Institute, listens, during an event at the White House, on Jan. 11, 2018. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I’ve always believed that farming is more than just a business. Especially in places like smalltown Arkansas, it’s a way of life. It’s our state’s culture, our history and what knits communities like McGehee together. If our farmers disappear, something critical to the spirit of Arkansas – and America – would disappear along with them. Brooke understands that fact – and she’s prepared to do something about it. I know that the first item on her to-do list is to work with new Republican majorities in the House and Senate to pass anupdated Farm Bill– legislation that hasn’t been thoroughly revised for ten years. I know she will work to undo the regulatory red tape that hamstrings our farmers and turns a difficult job into an impossible one. I know she is committed to improving broadband and connectivity in our small communities, helping rural Arkansas connect with the world. And I know she will fight to realize President Trump’s vision of a dominant America – in food, in energy and in everything else. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP My dad used to say that if a country can’t feed itself, fuel itself or fight for itself then it can’t survive. It’s not dramatic to say that we’re getting very near to that point – and we need a dramatic change in leadership to right the ship. Brooke Rollins is that leader.

        "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/class-dismissed-colleges-expected-close-enrollment-numbers-tank",
        "content": "A CNN guest told anchor Dana Bash that young men's concerns are about practical issues and fears about an upcoming war, not the cultural issues that DC elites discuss. It’s no big secret that the cost of attending afour-year collegeor university in the United States is out of control. It’s almost gravity defying how the cost of college has increased relative to regular inflation over the past twenty years. In fact, more than 500 nonprofit private colleges have shut down in the last decade according to the Wall Street Journal, which was \"three times what it was in the decade prior.\" The news is about to get worse, and there is a stern warning announcement coming from the pilot in the cockpit. 2025 is going to have a lot of turbulence followed by potentially weekly plane crashes of colleges and universities who can no longer afford to open their doors. This new reality is the ultimate law of supply and demand and families in America are voting with their feet. LOW ENROLLMENT AND FINANCIAL STRUGGLES FORCE A NY COLLEGE TO CLOSE: ‘IT’S REALLY UNFAIR TO EVERYONE' WHY ARE COLLEGES CLOSING AT SUCH A RAPID RATE? Enrollment Trend experts have new terminology they call the \"enrollment cliff.\" The number of students enrolled in degree-grantingcolleges and universitiesfell by 15% from 2010 to 2021 and only 62% of high school seniors in the U.S. immediately go on to college right now. That’s a stark contrast to almost fifteen years ago when the number was 68% in 2010, according to government data. Many of the students who opt out of a postsecondary education are low-income students, but even those with means are beginning to choose alternatives. We’ve also seen a spike in the competition for state colleges and universities where parents can enjoy in-state tuition and other possible grant programs offered for only in-state students. Beyond the fact that some students are taking certification courses versus going to college, some are entering the workplace and some are considering alternative career paths, we are experiencing a record low number of new babies in the United States which will have a long-term impact on the shrinking enrollment for colleges and universities. This trend of low birth rates began roughly 17 years ago. After hitting an all-time high in 2007, the Great Recession hit in 2008 causing fertility rates to plummet.  The national birth rate fell 23% between 2007 and 2022, and fast-forward to the present day, it isn’t apparent that generation Z twenty-somethings are itching to get a family going. This decline in theoverall birth rateis why beginning next year in 2025, and lasting until 2037, we are going to see a major decline in enrollment as 2008 babies begin to reach college age. It’s not the money… It’s the money Thirty plus years of providing financial advice for families across America and the number one complaint in the planning process isn’t about how much money someone is going to need to retire. The dialogue quickly shifts to how it’s going to be possible to put two, three, or even four kids through afour-year college education. Colleges and universities are starting to feel the financial pain. Even though these higher institutions don’t pay federal income tax or pay real estate taxes, the higher overall operating costs of having a five-star operation and state-imposed restrictions on tuition increases for public colleges have limited colleges and universities' ability to increase tuition revenue. Couple that with the overall market where families are voting with their feet to attend lower-cost colleges and universities, it has put a heavy strain on the ability of these institutions to remain fiscally solvent. While there are more than 150 colleges and universities boasting more than $1 billion dollars in endowment money, there’s a slew of others that are battling for enrollment, fighting for keeping academic talent and pondering how to keep facilities at a level that new college students have grown to expect from a school. This not only can affect theschoolitself, but the surrounding towns or cities where local business is built around the school. On average, each college or university that shuts down affects 265 jobs and $14 million dollars of labor income. To keep their head above water, some colleges have cut faculty and slashed areas of academic study, but it won’t be enough to face the Titanic-like cold water that many universities and colleges are about to face. Alternative Career Paths Under DOGE we may eventually see theDepartment of Educationeliminated.  And with the possibility of Pete Hegseth becoming the new Secretary of Defense, we may see a new pitch to young people about joining the United States military. We don’t yet what the future of education will look like in the United States, but it’s quite possible that teenagers in high school will have four potential career paths in the future. 1. College or university 2. Vocational school 3. Entrepreneurship 4. Military CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It’s now harder to find blue-collar workers than white-collar workers, reversing a decades-long trend in the U.S. job market. Take plumbers as an example. It’s expected by 2027 that the United States will be short some 550,000 plumbers, which is bad news for the cost to get plumbing fixed and the time it will take to find someone to fix it. These kinds of statistics are universal across all lines of home services blue collar workers. There are great careers in the military as well and military enlistment has been steadily down over the past 40 years. At the end of the 2023 fiscal year (September 2023), three branches reported falling short of their recruitment goals: the Navy was at 80% of its target number, the Army was at 77% and the Air Force was at 89%. The Marine Corps and Space Force were the only branches to meet their recruitment goals. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The total number of active-duty service members in the US armed forces declined roughly 6% from 2012 to 2022, from 1.4 million to 1.3 million. We are going to need more young people to join the military over the next 10 years. Closures are coming The cost of tuition and fees plus room and board for a four-year private college averaged $58,600 in the 2024-2025 school year. With inflation, that’s roughly $250,000 to get one child through a four-year college education. If parents and students continue to question the hefty price tag of a college education, we could see enrollment fall to record lows over the next decade and more colleges close their doors and shut down their operations. Class is not in session!

        "content": "Student who saved choking friend, Thomas Conley and his mother, Candice Conley, join 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Thomas being hailed as a hero after saving his choking classmate. Achoking emergencycan turn really scary, really quickly. Whether it’s yourself or another person, knowing how to remove the blockage while staying calm can be the difference between life and death. The Heimlich maneuver is a first-aid method recommended by most health organizations, which uses abdominal thrusts to dislodge an obstruction from aperson’s windpipe. BOY, 8, SAVES CHOKING FRIEND WITH HEIMLICH MANEUVER: SEE THE VIDEO Mass General Brigham, a health care system in Boston, Massachusetts, shared on its website step-by-step guidance on how to effectively perform the Heimlich, provided by emergency medicine doctor Wendy Macias-Konstantopoulos, MD. Before starting the Heimlich, check to make sure the person isn't breathing, talking or coughing, experts advise.(iStock) In any choking emergency, Mass General Brigham suggests first calling 911 to report that someone may need the help of a medical professional. If there is another person present, one person should call 911 while the other begins doing the Heimlich. The Heimlich maneuver should not be performed on someone who can still talk, breathe or cough, according to Macias-Konstantopoulos. BAD BUNNY'S HIT SONG HAS ‘RIGHT TEMPO’ FOR LIFE-SAVING CPR, AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION SAYS In that case, encourage someone exhibiting these signs tocontinue coughingto dislodge the object. If none of these signs are present, or if the person is exhibiting the universal choking sign, start by administering up to five sharp blows to the person’s back with the heel of your hand between their shoulder blades. If the person is exhibiting the universal choking sign, shown here, it is best to begin administering the Heimlich, experts say.(iStock) If the person is still choking after a few blows to the back, experts recommend starting the Heimlich maneuver. Macias-Konstantopoulos' guidance is to first stand behind the choking person, or kneel ifit’s a child. TEACHER, DRIVING HOME FROM WORK, PULLS OVER TO SAVE CHOKING 100-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WITH HEIMLICH MANEUVER Wrap your arms around their torso from the back. Make a fist with one hand and grab it with the other. Place your hands in between the person’s belly button and rib cage. Place your fist above the belly button and below the rib cage when administering the Heimlich, a doctor instructed.(iStock) Next, thrust in an inward and upward motion on the diaphragm. This will force air out of the lungs and remove the blockage. Repeat these abdominal thrusts up to five times, the doctor advised. If the choking continues, go back to the five back blows followed by five abdominal thrusts until the airway is cleared orhelp has arrived. For people who may be pregnant or obese, the Heimlich maneuver can be administered with five chest thrusts to the breastbone, or middle of the chest, instead of the abdomen. Mass General Brigham warned that the Heimlich maneuver should not be used on infants younger than 12 months. For more Health articles, visitfoxnews.com/health Instead, if a baby under a year old is choking, hold them face down along the length of your arm or thigh, keeping their head lower than their bottom. Sharply hit the baby on their back, firmly but not hard enough to injure them, up to five times, the health care system advised. Recommended Heimlich maneuvers vary between adults and children.(iStock) Once the blockage is dislodged, check the baby’s mouth and remove any visible objects with a finger. If the blows to the back don’t work, try performing chest thrusts by holding the baby face up in the same orientation. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Keep their head lower than their body and support the baby’s neck and head with your hand, according to Macias-Konstantopoulos.

        "content": "Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman and Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel have the latest on the spread of bird flu in the United States on ‘Fox News Live.’ The patient in Louisiana who was hospitalized withsevere bird flu illnesswas found to have a mutated version of the virus, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced last week. The fact that the virus mutated within the patient suggests that it couldpotentially spreadfrom human to human. The CDC analyzed samples of the H5N1 virus that were collected from the patient, comparing its genomic sequences to those of infected dairy cows, wild birds, poultry and other animals, the agency stated. BIRD FLU LEADS TO SEVERE HUMAN ILLNESS AND STATE OF EMERGENCY \"The analysis identified low frequency mutations in the hemagglutinin gene of a sample sequenced from the patient, which were not found in virus sequences from poultry samples collected on the patient’s property, suggesting the changes emerged in the patient after infection,\" the CDC said. The patient in Louisiana who was hospitalized with severe bird flu illness was found to have a mutated version of the virus, the CDC announced.(iStock) \"While these low frequency changes are rare in humans, they have been reported in previous cases of A(H5N1) in other countries and most often duringsevere disease.\" Based on the discovery of these genetic changes in the virus, health officials recommend performing \"ongoing genomic surveillance\" in people and animals, taking steps to containbird flu outbreaksamong dairy cattle and poultry, and taking steps to prevent transmission when exposed to infected animals or environments. BIRD FLU CAUSES DEATHS OF CATS AND ZOO ANIMALS AS VIRUS SPREADS IN US The CDC maintains that the risk to the general public is still low. \"The same mutations were not present in viral genomes sampled from the backyard birds that presumably infected the individual,\" Samuel Scarpino, director of AI and life sciences and professor of health sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, confirmed to Fox News Digital. The CDC analyzed samples of the H5N1 virus that were collected from the patient, comparing its genomic sequences to those of infected dairy cows, wild birds, poultry and other animals.(iStock) \"Because the mutations were present in the human patient, but not thebackyard birds, this suggests that the mutations arose during the course of that individual’s infection.\" Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, told Fox News Digital, shared his thoughts on the significance of this finding. \"Each human infection represents a spin of the epidemic roulette wheel.\" \"It is somewhat concerning that the H5N1 bird flu virus found in the Louisiana patient showed a mutation that allowed it to enter the upper airways more easily in this patient, but this mutation has been seen before,\" he told Fox News Digital. The good news, the doctor noted, is that there have not been any reports of theLouisiana patienttransmitting the virus to other humans. \"It is important that surveillance among domestic poultry and dairy cattle is extensive,\" Dr. Marc Siegel told Fox News Digital.(Photo by Uli Deck/picture alliance via Getty Images) \"We know the mutations to look out for in terms of the potential to spread among humans\" based on previous research, Siegel said. \"It is important that surveillance among domestic poultry and dairy cattle is extensive,\" he added.

        "content": "Susan Bresnahan's son, Patrick, was diagnosed with Timothy syndrome at 2 years old. She shares how his Golden Retriever service dog, Yammy, has provided help, comfort and support. When a 3-year-old New York boy was diagnosed with arare genetic disorder, hope came in an unlikely form: a golden retriever named Yammy. Susan Bresnahan’s son, Patrick, was born in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, she told Fox News Digital. Bresnahan, who has been a nurse for 20 years, noticed that her son wasn’t hitting any of the normal developmental milestones as he reached toddler age. RARE DISEASE DIAGNOSIS STRENGTHENS BOND BETWEEN TWIN SISTERS: ‘DOING OUR BEST’ \"I knew in my gut that something was wrong,\" she said during an on-camera interview.(See the video at the top of this article.) Patrick Bresnahan, now 4, was diagnosed with a rare neurodevelopmental genetic disorder at 2 years old.(Susan Bresnahan) After seeing many specialists and undergoinggenetic testing, young Patrick — just over 2 years old at the time — had a rare neurodevelopmental disorder called Timothy syndrome, the family learned. \"After getting the diagnosis, it was the first good night’s sleep I had in two years, because I was losing my mind knowing there was something really wrong,\" Bresnahan recalled. FAMILY SELLING DREAM HOME TO FUND LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT FOR 5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER Timothy syndrome occurs when there is a mutation of the CACNA1C gene, according to Cleveland Clinic. Fewer than 100 people are diagnosed worldwide. The life-threatening disorder can affect a child’s heart, cognitive abilities, nervous and immune systems, and physical appearance, the same source said. \"I was losing my mind knowing there was something really wrong.\" Initial symptoms can include certain physical characteristics,irregular heart function, seizures, trouble communicating and developmental delays, the last of which Bresnahan first noticed in her son. In many cases, Breshanan said, the CACNA1C mutation can bemistaken for autism, when the autism is really just a symptom of the genetic disorder. \"In Patrick's case, I feel strongly that if I wasn't a nurse, especially in pediatrics, I would be walking around saying my child has autism, but he doesn't,\" she noted. Timothy syndrome occurs when there is a mutation of the CACNA1C gene, according to Cleveland Clinic. Fewer than 100 people are diagnosed worldwide.(Susan Bresnahan) Although there is no cure for the syndrome, certain treatments can help manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Nearly 80% of diagnosed cases lead to fatal heart conditions in early childhood, according to Cleveland Clinic. Experts recommend early intervention after a diagnosis of Timothy syndrome. \"Besides theoccupational therapyand speech therapy, I just felt like I had to do more,\" Bresnahan told Fox News Digital. FATHER CREATED A DRUG TO SAVE HIS SON FROM A RARE DISEASE, NOW OTHER FAMILIES ARE DESPERATE TO GET IT \"So I asked a neurologist for thoughts on a service dog, because Patrick just had no motivation to move.\" The family started the process of getting a service dog at ECAD (Educated Canines Assisting with Disabilities) inTorrington, Connecticut, which matches up families with dogs suited to their needs. The Bresnahan family had to raise $25,000 for their portion of the cost to receive a service dog. \"It was amazing how people came forward to support us,\" Susan Bresnahan said.(Susan Bresnahan) Each ECAD dog receives more than 1,500 hours of training, according to Bresnahan. The person seeking a dog must also complete a two-week course at the ECAD facility before being matched with the animal that best suits their specific needs. The service dogs can be trained to open and close doors, turn on lights, retrieve items and steady people while walking or going upstairs. The Bresnahan family had to raise $25,000 for their portion of the cost to receive a service dog. Within three weeks, they had received the full amount through donations from friends, family and community members. MOTHER FRANTIC TO SAVE CLINICAL TRIAL THAT COULD CURE HER DAUGHTER: ‘THE TREATMENT IS SITTING IN A FRIDGE' \"It was unbelievable,\" Bresnahan recalled. \"I just cried for three weeks straight — it was amazing how people came forward to support us.\" A couple of years after starting the process, Patrick received his dog, Yammy. \"Within two weeks, he was doing 12 new things he had never done,\" she said. \"I really couldn't believe my eyes.\" \"It was a sense of security, having the dog next to him,\" Bresnahan said. Yammy has also increased her son's social ability and self-confidence, she added.(Susan Bresnahan) Patrick used to walk slowly and move \"clumsily\" — but he suddenly began walking, running and moving much more easily and smoothly with Yammy. He even started climbing steps, something he had never attempted before. \"It was a sense of security, having the dog next to him,\" Bresnahan said.

A South Carolina manconvicted in the brutal double murder of two bank employees in 2017 is asking for a \"compassionate release\" days after President Biden spared his life and commuted his death sentence. Brandon Council, 28, was convicted in September 2019 in the 2017 double murder of Conway bank employees Katie Skeen, 36, and Donna Major, 59. Council was then sentenced to death by a federal court one month later. Council was one of 37 federal inmates on death row who had their sentences commuted to life in prison by Biden. On Friday, Council filed a motion in the U.S. District Court in Florence arguing that he deserved a \"compassionate release\" because he had been subjected to \"severe, unnecessary, and unjustifiable psychological harm\" that \"can only be accurately construed and assimilated as an act of torture,\" since he was permanently housed in solitary confinement since Nov. 4, 2019,according to records obtained by WBTW.

Several people have openly disagreed with Biden’s decision to commute the death sentences, including Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C., who said the decision was \"shameful.\" \"Biden’s move to pardon 37 federal death row inmates - including 3 men from South Carolina who committed unspeakable acts - continues to shock Americans nationwide. This decision is shameful. It is high time to return America to a country of law and order,\" Fry wrote in a post on X. Fry added in another post following the announcement that Biden's decision \"disgraces victims’ memories nationwide.\" \"Joe Biden’s clemency for death row inmates disgraces victims’ memories nationwide, like Donna Major of Conway and Katie Skeen of Green Sea. This shows shocking disregard for innocent families’ pain, right at Christmas. January 20 cannot come soon enough,\" Fry wrote in his post on X. Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., echoed Fry and called Biden's actions \"senseless.\" \"President Biden's decision to commute the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates is not just senseless—it's an outrageous example of this administration's upside down and backwards ideology,\" Meuser wrote in a post on his X account.

I'm still angry. I am upset that this is even happening, that one man can make this decision without even talking to the victims, without any regard for what we've been through, what we're going through, and completely hurt, frustrated and angry,\" Major's daughter Heather Turner said during the Christmas Eve interview. Donna Major, 59, and Kathryn (Katie) Skeen, 36, were killed in cold blood by Brandon Council while he robbed a South Carolina bank in 2017.(Derek Shoemake) \"She was shown no mercy at all. This man walked into the bank, never said two words to her. Shot her three times in total. He went and shot her coworker, Katie Skeen as well, who was totally defenseless and unaware of anything happening,\" Major's husband, Danny Jenkins, added during the show. \"I can't even believe that this is actually happening…\" Council spent a week at a motel across from the CresCom Bank in Conway, South Carolina, where he watched the movie \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" before he went in with a gun and killed both Skeen and Major. Council already had a prior felony conviction at the time and told an FBI agent that he went into the bank knowing he wouldkill someone during the robbery. He had been on parole for a month at the time of the murders, which came during his second bank robbery since leaving prison.

More than a million visitors are expected in Times Square on Tuesday to attend the 120th tradition of watching the ball drop on the stroke of the New Year. This year, the NYPD’s class of more than 600 new recruits will work their first detail Tuesday night. At a press conference about security preparations on Monday, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said there are no credible threats to the Times Square event at this time, but the department has been operating in a \"heightened threat environment\" since the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel.

In her lawsuit, the former inmate is accusing state officials of depriving her First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. According to the complaint, she raised concerns to officials who allegedly failed to intervene, even as Williams had faced similar accusations from another woman. They also allegedly threatened Clark by telling her going public with her claims would be considered a \"hate crime,\" according to her legal team. \"This case is about more than one person’s suffering,\" Pivtorak said. \"It’s about challenging policies that disregard the safety and dignity of women, and ensuring that institutions are held accountable for their failures.\" Clark is seeking unspecified damages and legal costs."

        "content": "The United States is 'seeing a huge shift' in pro-law enforcement rhetoric and legislation after the 2024 election, National Police Association spokesperson Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith (Ret.) told Fox News Digital. Law and order made a strong comeback in 2024, with voters across the U.S.rejecting soft-on-crime policiestouted by progressive district attorneys and voting to bolster police budgets once slashed by the defund police movement. The progressive crime agenda, largely pushed by liberal megadonorGeorge Soros, suffered a string of major defeats in November, with voters soundly rejecting progressive prosecutors, blaming their permissive policies for rising crime in the U.S. as alleged drug dealers, thieves and repeat offenders were returned to the streets within hours of their arrests. In November, California votersoverwhelmingly votedin favor of Prop 36, which sought to restore tough penalties for drugs and theft.Every single county in the state voted in favor of the proposition. SOROS DAS SUFFER 12 BIG DEFEATS, BILLIONAIRE'S AGENDA FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE Progressives suffered another major loss in the city of Los Angeles, where District Attorney George Gascón, backed by Soros, was defeated by former federal prosecutor Nathan Hochmanas crime was seen as a top issueof the election cycle. Gascón was ushered into office in 2020 amid a reckoning over police misconduct and national calls for criminal justice reform. His directives — such as the elimination of cash bail, not seeking the death penalty and refusing to try underage defendants charged with violent crimes as adults — led to two recall attempts as voters accused him of letting criminals run rampant in the city. Hungarian-born US investor and philanthropist George Soros and Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón.(Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images, left, and Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP, right.) Residents viewed Gascón’s policies as a \"middle finger\" to victims of crime. Cully Stimson, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation and co-author of the book \"Rogue Prosecutors: How Radical Soros Lawyers Are Destroying America's Communities,\"told Fox News Digital, adding that the \"Achilles heel\" of the progressive prosecutor movement continues to be the \"invalidity and lack of common sense\" that leads \"directly to rising crime rates.\" In another loss for Soros-backed prosecutors in the Golden State, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Pricewas recalled, less than two years after taking office following backlash for her alleged soft-on-crime approach. Oakland Democratic Mayor Sheng Thao, who faced heat from her constituents amid rising crime, was also ousted from office after her recall effort passed with 65% of the vote. VOTERS SEEKING LAW AND ORDER CHEER OUSTING OF PROGRESSIVE OREGON DISTRICT ATTORNEY In other areas of the liberal bastion state, hard-on-crime San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins comfortably beat out prosecutor Ryan Khojasteh, the handpicked candidate of former district attorney Chesa Boudin, who was recalled in 2022. San Francisco's Democratic Mayor London Breed alsolost her re-election campaignas crime remained a major concern of voters.

She represented the same county where nursing student Laken Riley was allegedly killed by an illegal migrant, who had been arrested and then released before the brutal crime. Oregon's Nathan Vasquez, a longtime prosecutor, beat his boss, Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt, in a nonpartisan primary election in May. Vasquez launched a tough-on-crime-campaign, receiving endorsements from several police groups, crime victims and business owners. Residents blamed Schmidt's revolving door policies for exacerbating crime and creating a feeling of lawlessness in the City of Roses,cheering Vasquez's victoryas an indication that Americans are finally turning the page on the woke left's approach to crime. 'FAILED EXPERIMENT': EXPERTS REVEAL WHY SOROS-BACKED POLICIES TOOK BEATING IN DEEP BLUE STATE Sean Kennedy, the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund’s policy director, told Fox News Digital in November that out of the roughly75 Soros-linked prosecutorshis organization has identified since 2022, over 30 have left office, while 20 have been replaced by traditional district attorneys. In 2020, local and federal politicians met demands from protesters to\"defund\" or \"dismantle\" police departmentsacross the country. Intending to reform the criminal justice system, they passed bills aimed at moving police funds to other entities or changing the way police pursue suspects after George Floyd's murder. But as homicide rates and violent crime rose rapidly,Americans began to push back. Four years later, residents are frustrated with the state of crime in some areas and sought in the 2024 election to give more power and funding to law enforcement.

Earlier in the year, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston cut $8 million from its police department spending to help fund programs for the soaring number of migrants arriving in the city. In Arizona, voters approved Proposition 314, which will make entering the country illegally a state crime on top of a federal crime and broadens the power of police officers to arrest those who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. Voters in Dallas, Texas also showed support for pro-law enforcement initiatives, voting for Proposition U, which won by just over 50% and aims to increase funding for the police department, requiring it to maintain a force of 4,000 officers. Voters voted to bolster police budgets in November after four years of grappling with the ramifications of the defund police movement.(Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) BURLINGTON LEADERSHIP CALL FOR MORE OFFICERS, MORE PROGRAMS AFTER CITY DEFUNDED POLICE: ‘THAT WAS A MISTAKE’ In Vermont, community leaders in Burlington, a town currently dealing with troubling levels of homelessness, drug addiction and crime, are also actively exploring ways toboost the city's police presenceand bolster police resources after the force was partially defunded in 2020.

Every day, I put on my buckled shoes and my 18th century-style wool stockings. \"Noticing the small things, and being grateful for them, has made my life much better.\" Those stockings had no elastic, and they would slide down my calves and form a little puddle around my ankles. So I did what our ancestors did. I wore sock belts.

I will never get back the combined hours that I spent putting on sock belts during my year. It’s a small thing, I know. But that’s the point. As part of his year-long celebration of the U.S. Constitution, Jacobs baked a series of \"election cakes\" to honor the right and privilege of voting.(A.J.

They were smelly and dangerous and cruel.

When you could die from an infected cut on your finger. When cutting-edge medicine included the \"tobacco enema,\" in which a doctor would literally blow smoke up your rear end.

I recentlymade a pilgrimageto the National Archives in Washington, D.C., to see the United States Constitution — the one that George Washington and 38 other Founders signed with a goose quill 238 years ago. When you enter the rotunda where the Constitution is displayed, it almost feels like you’re visiting a cathedral, minus the smell of incense.(See the video at the top of this article.)

        "content": "A.J. Jacobs of New York City, bestselling author of \"The Year of Living Constitutionally,\" told Fox News Digital why thinking of others was so important when our country was founded — and why \"doing good\" remains relevant today. It’s well known that Ben Franklin was a morning person. In his \"Poor Richard’s Almanac,\" he famously said, \"Early to bed, early to rise, makes a manhealthy, wealthy and wise.\" But what did Ben Franklin do when he got up early? What was his morning ritual? That is less well known. In his autobiography, Ben Franklin wrote that the first thing he did when he woke up each day was to ask himself the following question: \"What good shall I do this day?\"(See the video at the top of this article.) CAKE AND DEMOCRACY ARE A ‘SWEET' COMBINATION, SAYS BESTSELLING AUTHOR: ‘FREEDOM IS A TREAT’ I love Ben Franklin’s ritual. For most of my adult life, my default morning thoughts included questions such as, \"What annoying tasks do I have to do this day?\" and \"What terrible things have happened in the world that I’ll read about when I open my laptop?\" A.J. Jacobs, a New York City-based bestselling author (shown at right), spent a year \"living\" the Constitution — which included getting closer to the lives of America's Founding Fathers. Shown at left Ben Franklin.(iStock; A.J. Jacobs) Nowadays, I try instead to do what Ben Franklin advises: I ask myself, \"What good can I do today?\" Written on a piece of paper, it now hangs over my desk as a reminder. This new habit is the result of the year I spent recently trying to live like the Founding Fathers. I wrote about the wisdom I learnedin my new book, \"The Year of Living Constitutionally.\" \"The Founders’ idea of virtue meant public-mindedness. A virtuous person puts the interests of others before their own interests.\" As Franklin’s morning ritual implies, the Founders were obsessed with the idea of virtue. Nowadays, the word \"virtue\" has a bit of a cringey and fusty ring to it. MAKING STUFF BY HAND TAPS INTO THE GREAT TRADITION OF AMERICAN INDIVIDUALISM I hear the word most often used in the phrase \"virtue signaling,\" which is not a compliment. \"Virtue signaling\" refers to someone who is ostentatiously trying to show off how righteous they are by, for instance, loudly asking a waiter about the living conditions of the bees that produced the honey for their oatmeal. \"The Founders’ idea of virtue meant public-mindedness,\" said Jacobs. \"A virtuous person puts the interests of others before their own interests. A virtuous person focuses on those two key words in the Constitution’s preamble: ‘General Welfare.’\"(A.J. Jacobs; iStock) In the Founders' era, the word virtue had no such mixed connotations. Virtue was a cherished ideal. In his book \"First Principles,\" Thomas E. Ricks writes that the Founders used the word virtue about 6,000 times in the collected writings from the Revolutionary era. That’s more often than the word \"freedom.\" \"I almost wish the Constitution had a Bill of Responsibilities.\" The Founders’ idea of virtue meant public-mindedness. A virtuous person puts the interests of others before their own interests. A virtuous person focuses on those two key words inthe Constitution’s preamble: \"General Welfare.\" IN AN ELECTION YEAR, AMERICANS NEED FEWER HOT TAKES AND MORE COOL-HEADED REASONING I think we’re due for a resurgence of virtue. I know I could use more of it. As a rule, I’m too focused on my individual rights. Rights are wonderful, and I’m grateful that I live in a country that puts an emphasis on individual rights. But rights come with responsibilities. I almost wish the Constitution had a Bill of Responsibilities. A.J. Jacobs, pictured at left with members of his family, \"lived\" the Constitution for a year — which included sharpening his own quill pen, at right, and growing closer to the meaning and intent of the Founding Fathers.(A.J. Jacobs) The idea of public responsibility, I believe, was more ingrained in the 18th century and didn’t need to be spelled out. You were expected to sacrifice for your community. If there was a fire, you were expected to be part of the bucket brigade, helping to save your neighbor’s house. If you were a man, you were expected to be a part of your local militia. \"If I’m depressed, I find the best thing to do is to help others. It gets me out of my head.\" When my wife and kids and I wrote a Constitutionfor our family— an exercise I fully recommend — we included a Bill of Rights, but also a Bill of Responsibilities. WHY AMERICANS NEED MORE FACE-TO-FACE CIVIL DISCUSSIONS 'WITH FOLKS OUTSIDE THEIR OWN BUBBLE' It’s not about being saintly. Service actually wasn’t opposed to happiness. It was integral to it. Jacobs is shown with an \"Election Cake\" offering as part of his \"Year of Living Constitutionally,\" the title of his most recent book. He writes that service to others \"wasn’t opposed to happiness. It was integral to it.\"(A.J.

It was aboutdoinggood.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I find this observation to be true in my own life.If I’m depressed,I find the best thing to do is to help others.

        "content": "Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on how President-elect Trump’s Defense Department picks could affect the United States keeping up with China on ‘Special Report.’ As NATO member states struggle to meet their defense spending goals and war rages on Europe's eastern front,officials are strugglingto agree on a plan to shore up hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster defenses. Eight NATO countriesdid not meet their 2% target for defense spending in 2024. And as many member states struggle with chronically stressed budgets, calls to meet those goals are not being heeded quickly. The European Commission estimates about 500 billion euros, the equivalent of $524 billion in investments, are needed in the coming decade to defend Europe against evolving threats. NATO LEADERS PREDICT ERA OF 2% DEFENSE SPENDING 'PROBABLY HISTORY' AS TRUMP REPORTEDLY FLOATS HIGHER TARGET The EU's budget cannot be used to fund defense directly, and some European officials and NATO experts are proposing a global defense bank to dole out funds for military modernization. A defense, security and resilience (DSR) bank would issue bonds backed by AAA ratings for financially strapped countries to upgrade their defenses and would provide guarantees for commercial banks to offer credit to defense suppliers. European officials are struggling to agree on a plan to shore up hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster defenses.(U.S. Army photo by Spc. Ryan Parr) \"This is not a substitute to raising defense spending in each of these countries. I think it should be a supplemental tool,\" Giedrimas Jeglinskas, chairman of the national security committee in the Lithuanian parliament and a former NATO official, told Fox News Digital. His remarks echo those of incoming President Trump, who has long threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO due to the number of nations missing the mark on the 2% goal for defense spending. \"I think we have to look at it also as an opportunity for the U.S. as well,\" Jeglinskas added. \"I understand the skepticism by Donald Trump of the World Bank and then the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and IFC [International Finance Corporation] and other institutions. I think there's been a lot of capital deployed and a lot of investments that these banks or institutions do. The real impact is, at best, questionable. So, I think we have to have very clear KPIs [key performance indicators]. We need to build defense.\" The United States' $824 billion defense budget in 2023 equaled half of total defense spending by all NATO member states combined at $1.47 trillion. PUTIN SAYS RUSSIA READY TO COMPROMISE WITH TRUMP ON UKRAINE WAR The return of Trump to the White House, coupled with a U.S. push to refocus on China, has left Europeans wondering whether the U.S. will have less of an appetite to defend Europe in years to come. More EU defense chiefs and foreign ministers have pitched the idea of issuing joint debt through bonds to finance military projects. But some countrieslike Germanyhave voiced concerns about maintaining their own sovereignty and a disproportionate financial burden on some countries. The DSR bank idea is explained at length in anew Atlantic Council reportby defense fellow Rob Murray. The EU's budget cannot be used to fund defense directly.(Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File) \"For allies across both the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, the bank could go beyond offering low-interest loans for defense modernization to facilitating equipment leasing, currency hedging, and supporting critical infrastructure and rebuilding efforts in conflict zoneslike Ukraine,\"Murray wrote. \"An additional critical function of the DSR bank would be to underwrite the risk for commercial banks, enabling them to extend financing to defense companies across the supply chain.\" The goal would be to offer financing to small and medium-sized defense companies that often struggle with access to funds. \"By providing loans with extended maturities, the bank would offer predictable and sustainable funding for defence modernisation. Its governance structures would align funding with collective security goals, such as upgrading arsenals and investing in emerging technologies,\" Jeglinskas wrote in a recent op-ed for the Financial Times. A defense, security and resilience (DSR) bank would issue bonds backed by AAA ratings for financially strapped countries to upgrade their defenses.(Alexandra Beier/Getty Images) Asked how the DSR bank would get countries to agree on defense funding priorities, Jeglinskas likened the idea to the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force, a military alliance that includes Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Jeglinskas noted the 33 trillion euros in European assets under management across the continent. \"There's really no political will, no risk appetite to move them anywhere besides the kind of bond markets where they rest now,\" he said. \"But several nations need to build that initial capital, and then, by using the sovereign rating to get to hopefully AAA in capital markets, raise that money from bond markets and to start funding defense programs.\" The European Investment Bank has doled out long-term loans and guarantees to European nations' projects that align with EU policy goals. \"But even they are struggling with kind of shifting their mandate towards more dual-use technologies is still not allowed in their funding package,\" said Jeglinskas. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Of course, every other bank in Europe is looking at EIB for their signals. That signaling hasn't been there yet. So, that's the point. We need to create some sort of mechanism, and that kind of global defense bank would be one of the tools that we could use to rally the capital and really direct it toward defense. So, it's really creating another multilateral lending institution.\""

TRAVEL IN TIME TO 5 DESTINATIONS THAT SALUTE BATTLES AND WAR HEROES RIGHT HERE AT HOME The Utah, a battleship, was moored at Pearl Harbor when Japanese planes began bombing the Hawaii naval base in the early hours of Dec. 7, 1941, in an attack that propelled the U.S.into World War II.

He recalled that no one on board knew what made the ship shake. Then, the second torpedo hit and the ship began to list and capsize.

By 2020, there were only three crew members of the Utah still alive, including himself. There were an estimated 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack, according to military historian J. Michael Wenger. After Upton's death, only 15 are still alive."

Most commercial planes reach between 150 and 180 miles per hour before takeoff depending on the weight of the aircraft. So, the impact of the charter plane could have been lethal. \"In the years I’ve been doing this, I’ve never heard a ATC controller tell a plane to ‘Stop, stop, stop,’\" the plane spotter was heard saying.

        "content": "Donna Major's husband Danny Jenkins and daughters Heather Turner and Katie Jenkins call out President Biden for commuting the death sentence of her murderer. A South Carolina manconvicted in the brutal double murder of two bank employees in 2017 is asking for a \"compassionate release\" days after President Biden spared his life and commuted his death sentence. Brandon Council, 28, was convicted in September 2019 in the 2017 double murder of Conway bank employees Katie Skeen, 36, and Donna Major, 59. Council was then sentenced to death by a federal court one month later. Council was one of 37 federal inmates on death row who had their sentences commuted to life in prison by Biden. On Friday, Council filed a motion in the U.S. District Court in Florence arguing that he deserved a \"compassionate release\" because he had been subjected to \"severe, unnecessary, and unjustifiable psychological harm\" that \"can only be accurately construed and assimilated as an act of torture,\" since he was permanently housed in solitary confinement since Nov. 4, 2019,according to records obtained by WBTW. TRUMP EXECUTION RESTART TO PUT BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER, CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTER, MORE KILLERS IN HOT SEAT Brandon Council is one of 37 federal death row inmates who escaped execution following President Biden's decision to commute their sentences.(DeathPenaltyInfo.org) A compassionate release is described bythe American Bar Organizationas the process by which those incarcerated may seek early release, whether to community supervision or to their communities, due to extraordinary or compelling circumstances. Several people have openly disagreed with Biden’s decision to commute the death sentences, including Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C., who said the decision was \"shameful.\" \"Biden’s move to pardon 37 federal death row inmates - including 3 men from South Carolina who committed unspeakable acts - continues to shock Americans nationwide. This decision is shameful. It is high time to return America to a country of law and order,\" Fry wrote in a post on X. Fry added in another post following the announcement that Biden's decision \"disgraces victims’ memories nationwide.\" \"Joe Biden’s clemency for death row inmates disgraces victims’ memories nationwide, like Donna Major of Conway and Katie Skeen of Green Sea. This shows shocking disregard for innocent families’ pain, right at Christmas. January 20 cannot come soon enough,\" Fry wrote in his post on X. Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., echoed Fry and called Biden's actions \"senseless.\" \"President Biden's decision to commute the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates is not just senseless—it's an outrageous example of this administration's upside down and backwards ideology,\" Meuser wrote in a post on his X account. FAMILY OF MURDERED SC WOMAN RAGES AT BIDEN FOR COMMUTING KILLER'S DEATH SENTENCE: 'SHE WAS SHOWN NO MERCY' During an interview with\"Fox & Friends,\"Major's family said they were livid after Biden commuted her killer's death sentence just days before Christmas. \"I was angry. I'm still angry. I am upset that this is even happening, that one man can make this decision without even talking to the victims, without any regard for what we've been through, what we're going through, and completely hurt, frustrated and angry,\" Major's daughter Heather Turner said during the Christmas Eve interview. Donna Major, 59, and Kathryn (Katie) Skeen, 36, were killed in cold blood by Brandon Council while he robbed a South Carolina bank in 2017.(Derek Shoemake) \"She was shown no mercy at all. This man walked into the bank, never said two words to her. Shot her three times in total. He went and shot her coworker, Katie Skeen as well, who was totally defenseless and unaware of anything happening,\" Major's husband, Danny Jenkins, added during the show. \"I can't even believe that this is actually happening…\" Council spent a week at a motel across from the CresCom Bank in Conway, South Carolina, where he watched the movie \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" before he went in with a gun and killed both Skeen and Major. Council already had a prior felony conviction at the time and told an FBI agent that he went into the bank knowing he wouldkill someone during the robbery. He had been on parole for a month at the time of the murders, which came during his second bank robbery since leaving prison. FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IN DEATH ROW CASE SPEAKS ON BIDEN COMMUTING MURDERER'S SENTENCE: 'MY HEART ACHES' President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end theBiden-Harris administration'smoratorium on federal executions when he returns to office. Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Christmas Day to call out Biden for his commutation decision. \"They know that their only chance of survival is getting pardons from a man who has absolutely no idea what he is doing,\" Trump's post read. \"Also, to the 37 most violent criminals who killed, raped, and plundered like virtually no one before them, but were just given, incredibly, a pardon by Sleepy Joe Biden.

TheNew York CityPolice Department (NYPD) said Monday it continues to operate under a \"heightened threat environment\" ahead of the Times Square New Year's Eve celebration. More than a million visitors are expected in Times Square on Tuesday to attend the 120th tradition of watching the ball drop on the stroke of the New Year. This year, the NYPD’s class of more than 600 new recruits will work their first detail Tuesday night. At a press conference about security preparations on Monday, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said there are no credible threats to the Times Square event at this time, but the department has been operating in a \"heightened threat environment\" since the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. New York City has seen mass demonstrations against Israel, including the encampments, antisemitic rallying cries and clashes with police seenat Columbia Universityand New York University earlier this year. ERIC ADAMS REPORTEDLY SIGNALING HE WILL COOPERATE WITH TRUMP, ICE TO CRACKDOWN ON IMMIGRATION \"We remain vigilant,\" Tisch told reporters. \"The public can expect to see a tremendous amount of police resources deployed throughout the area and across the city. That includes members of some of our elite specialized units, including our emergency services unit, who will be strategically deployed throughout the area on rooftops. Our K-9 teams, who will patrol with bomb sniffing dogs. Our aviation unit will be in the skies scanning the event and the surrounding areas with special attention to the bridges and other landmarks. And of course, our drones will be deployed overhead to monitor the crowds in real time and watch for any suspicious or unusual activity.\" Last year, the NYPD had about four drone teams inside the \"bow tie\" and \"frozen area\" around Times Square for New Year's Eve. That will increase to six drone teams – four inside the bow tie and two on the outer perimeter – this year, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry said, adding that mobile drone teams will also operate around Manhattan and the rest of the city and monitor activity over the water as well.

Apsychiatrist from Saudi Arabiawas reportedly arrested in connection to the Dec. 20 car-ramming at a crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, that killed five people, including a nine-year-old boy, and injured over 200 others. \"Every year we formulate our plan based on incidents that are happening around the world, here in the city,\" Rebecca Weiner, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism, said. \"Christmas markets – you just flagged a terrible incidentin Germany involving Christmas markets– they're a persistent, high-risk target, and so, frankly, are New Year's Eve celebrations around the world, which is why we put so much emphasis on all of the resources that are here focused on keeping this city and this event safe. So it's absolutely calibrated to what's happening overseas.\" Noting precautions against vehicle ramming incidents, including NYPD trucks and blocked cars at the scene, Weiner added, \"We are very confident it's going to be a safe and enjoyable evening for all.\" People participate in the New Year's Eve Confetti Test in Times Square on Dec. 29, 2024, in New York City.

But some newly emergent threats, newly emergent crime patterns that we have, again, tried to combat very early and very deeply so that we haven't had the entrenchment of some of this gang here in the city that you've seen elsewhere across the country.\" The NYPD will also utilize pickpocket teams, as well as \"hotel response teams\" to monitor for suspicious activity or other \"anomalous\" events.

        "content": "‘Talk Money to Me’ author Jason Tartick joins ‘The Big Money Show’ to discuss his new book, shedding light on the importance of discussing your finances with your partner. Americans have historically been averse to discussing financial matters among family members, but a recent study by Fidelity Investments found that attitudes towardtaboo wealth topicsare shifting. Fidelity'sState of Wealth Mobility studyfound that 56% of Americans didn't discuss family finances with their parents when they were children. Of that group, 82% wish that they had, because they think it would've been beneficial to have received a financial education at an earlier age. It also found that Americans' attitudes to those talks are changing, with 83% of respondents saying that it's important to talk aboutmoney managementwith children, and 67% of parents already talking to their children about family finances. \"Money and wealth is one of the topics that, notoriously, we just don't like to talk about historically,\" David Peterson, head of advanced wealth solutions at Fidelity Investments, told FOX Business. \"Wealth is like a deeply personal experience, so in some respects, it's not surprising that people have historically been uncomfortable talking about it.\" WHAT NET WORTH DOES ONE NEED TO BE RICH IN 2024? HERE'S WHAT AMERICANS THINK Americans' attitudes toward once-taboo financial conversations are easing, Fidelity's study found.(iStock / iStock) \"The study indicated that people are starting to sort of break that cycle of avoiding the family discussions. And so clearly, if we relate that then to theintergenerational wealth transfer, that is sort of a generational difference, and what we found is that older people generally – they're just not as comfortable talking about it,\" Peterson said. Peterson said that many Americans have experienced the complications that can arise when a parent who hasn't been as open about their finances begins to decline, and family members have to step in to help take care of their finances. \"When people start reaching end of life, and they suddenly can't manage their own finances or they no longer have the capacity to make decisions around it, this is where you start to see things kind of go sideways a little bit, because they haven't shared with their families what their wealth is, where the wealth is, what it's made of,\" he said. \"And you can find yourself very quickly in a situation where, during a really emotional time of life, people are now worried about, well, how do we actually manage mom and dad's finances when they can no longer do it themselves?\" MYSTERIOUS $7B ESTATE TAX PAYMENT SPURS QUESTIONS ABOUT SOURCE OF FUNDS Peterson suggested that families approach financial conversations as a process, rather than trying to take care of it all at once.(iStock) He said that it's important for families to have documents including a health care proxy or health carepower of attorneyto help navigate the health care system, as well as a living will with instructions about the individual's hopes around that. A financial power of attorney that entrusts someone to act on their behalf on financial matters is another key document. Families should also consider other documents and designations needed for end-of-life, Peterson said.Brokerage accountsthat can be jointly titled with rights of survivorship can be transferred very easily to the surviving owner, while beneficiary designations can also be included to transfer accounts on death to the beneficiary. \"You need a will, which is going to account for all the things that don't really have a title to it or a beneficiary designation on it,\" he added. \"And then, in some cases, it might be beneficial to have a trust and put assets in that trust so that they can pass, similarly to an account with a beneficiary designation. The trust will then define who gets all those assets that are in the trust.\" BUFFETT TALKS MORTALITY AND PHILANTHROPY IN SURPRISE SHAREHOLDER LETTER Fidelity's study found that people with financial plans have more confidence about building and protecting their wealth.(iStock / iStock) Peterson suggested that to get the ball rolling it can be helpful to do so with the understanding that it's not likely to be a one-off conversation and more of a process to ease some of the pressure and emotions surrounding those talks. \"I think for some people, having a very strict itinerary of what you're going to talk about works very well; in other cases it doesn't, and my recommendation is not going into the conversation thinking that it's going to be a one-and-done kind of conversation. These are hard conversations to have,\" Peterson said. \"Look, I'm in the business, and I remember having the conversation with my dad, who's now passed, and you would think it'd be easy for me, but it's not, because these things are wrapped up in all sorts of emotions.\" Sharing some details about financial accounts and points of contact can also be a good first step, even if it doesn't necessarily lead to full disclosures about the specifics of an older person's wealth, he explained. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE \"Given particularly older generations aren't as willing to reveal necessarily all the specifics of their wealth, what I often recommend is that you at least share what it is, not necessarily the amount, but where it is; who are the key people to contact in the event that a family member has to know more about it. And keep all these things in a place that's easy for people to find,\" Peterson said. \"Probably the first step is just doing a really robust inventory of what's there, a balance sheet, a wealth statement, a net worth statement, whatever you want to call it – but just this list of things so that when someone has to act on it, they at least know where to go,\" he explained. \"And that way, you sort of protect this sensitivity around how much is in all of these different accounts orbanks or financial institutions.\" Regardless of the process individual families use to build their financial plans, Fidelity's study found that having a plan is a confidence booster. While about four in 10 Americans are worried about losing their wealth, 78% with a financial plan said they're confident they've taken the right steps to build and protect their wealth, compared to 26% and 27%, respectively, of those without plans."

She was instructed to press Ctrl + Shift + Esc, unfreezing her computer, but the instructions didn’t stop there. The scammer directed her to download software from UltraViewer.net, a legitimate remote access tool often exploited by bad actors. Here’s what you should know if you ever encounter a similar scam. GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE Windows Defender pop-up scam(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 1) Unsolicited pop-ups claiming to be from Microsoft or other security services:Janet’s story highlights a common scam tactic, which is fake alerts masquerading as official warnings. Microsoft and other legitimate companies do not issue pop-ups with support numbers or direct you to download remote access software. 2) Urgent audio and visual cues:Scammers create a sense of urgency with sirens, flashing messages and warnings of dire consequences to push victims into immediate action without thinking critically. 3) Requests to install remote access software:Scammers often use tools like UltraViewer, TeamViewer or AnyDesk to gain access to victims’ systems. While these tools are legitimate for remote tech support, downloading them at the request of an unknown party is a red flag. Windows Defender pop-up scam(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THE ‘APPLE ID SUSPENDED’ PHISHING SCAM If you come across a scam, it's important to act quickly and take the following steps to protect yourself and your information. If you receive a suspicious pop-up, do not call the number provided or follow any on-screen instructions. Look up any suspicious phone numbers or messages independently. Use Ctrl + Alt + Del to open the Task Manager and close the browser or application displaying the message. Scammers thrive on urgency. Take a moment to assess the situation calmly. Janet asked if the scammers could have taken any information. Here’s what to do. If you installed UltraViewer or similar tools, uninstall them immediately. Update passwords for critical accounts, prioritizing your email and banking logins. Consider using apasswordmanagerto generate and store complex passwords. Enabletwo-factor authentication, as this adds a layer of security even if someone obtains your login credentials. If you suspect that your computer is still compromised, it might be best to consult with a professional to ensure your system is secure. You may want to reach out toMicrosoft Supportfor additional guidance and to report the incident to help prevent others from falling victim. Windows Defender pop-up scam(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM Janet also mentioned that her antivirus software didn’t flag the scam. Unfortunately, many of these scams rely on social engineering rather than malware to bypass antivirus detection. They exploit human psychology, not just technical vulnerabilities. However, running regular scans can still help detect hidden threats. IS JUST READING THAT SKETCHY SCAMMER'S EMAIL DANGEROUS OR DO I HAVE TO CLICK ON A LINK TO GET IN TROUBLE? First, don't be the slightest bit embarrassed, as it could have happened to genuinely anyone. And the worst thing you can do is stay silent. You can help prevent this from happening to others. Stop all communication:Cease all contact with the scammer immediately. Do not engage further or respond to any messages or calls from them. Report the scam:Report the incident to your local law enforcement agency or the cybercrime unit in your country. Provide them with all the information you have about the scammer and the communication you had with them. Notify your bank and credit card companies:If you shared any financial information, contact your bank and credit card companies right away. Inform them about the potential scam and ask for advice on how to secure your accounts. Monitor your accounts:Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Report any unauthorized transactions immediately. Inform credit bureaus:Consider contacting credit reporting agencies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent the scammer from opening new accounts in your name. Be cautious about future communications:Be vigilant regarding any future communications from unknown sources. Scammers may try to target you again using different tactics. Use identity theft protection:If a scammer gets a hold of your personal information, you may consider a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process. One of the best things you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service. One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to $1 million to cover losses and legal feesand awhite-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case managerhelps you recover any losses.Read more of my review of the best identity theft protection services here. Janet’s experience is a reminder that even the most vigilant among us can fall prey to clever scams designed to exploit fear and urgency. By recognizing red flags like unsolicited pop-ups, high-pressure tactics and requests for remote access, you can protect yourself and your personal information. If you ever encounter a situation like Janet’s, remember to stay calm, verify the legitimacy of any alerts and take the necessary steps to secure your system. Scammers rely on quick reactions, so slow down, stay in control and don’t let them manipulate your next move. Have you seen any new scams lately that others should know about?

        "content": "More than 20 years later, the system is getting a makeover. Smart home cameras have become a necessity. You already know they help keep an eye on what’s happening indoors and outdoors, even when you’re not home. But while these cameras are undeniably useful, they also pose aprivacy risk. A new study highlights outdoor security camera apps as some of the biggest collectors of user data. This includes sensitive personal information like email addresses, phone numbers, payment details, precise location and more. GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE Smart outdoor camera(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) According to astudy conducted by Surfshark, outdoor security camera apps are some of the top offenders when it comes to collecting user data. These apps gather 12 data points on average, including sensitive details like email addresses, phone numbers, payment information and precise location. That’s 50% more than what other smart home devices typically collect. What’s even worse is that these apps often connect up to seven of these data points directly to your identity. Indoor securitycamera appsare slightly less data-hungry but still raise privacy concerns. They collect an average of nine data points, with six typically tied to users' identities. Commonly collected data includes email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, device IDs, purchase histories and audio data. While this information can help improve the user experience, it also increases the risk of privacy violations. One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn’t actually necessary for the apps to do their job. Smart camera(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC Among the apps that collect the most data, Deep Sentinel and Lorex stand out for outdoorsecurity cameras, each collecting 18 out of a possible 32 data points. Nest Labs, which leads the pack for indoor cameras, collects 17 data points, with Ring and Arlo each gathering 15. The absence of regulations and standards for smart home devices creates significant privacy risks. Without clear guidelines, users are vulnerable to data breaches, cyberattacks and even physical harm. Some apps track users for targeted ads or share data with third parties and data brokers. While outdoor security cameras typically avoid tracking, indoor cameras like Nooie and Canary Connect engage in user tracking, further complicating privacy concerns. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Smart indoor camera(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH 1. Limit data sharing:Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information. 2. Regularly review and update privacy settings:Smart home cameras often receive software updates that may change privacy settings. It’s important to regularly review the app’s privacy settings to make sure they align with your preferences. Disable features that aren’t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers. 3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA):Make sure your camera’s app and associated accounts are protected by strong, unique passwords. Consider using apassword managerto generate and store complex passwords. 4. Enabletwo-factor authentication(2FA) wherever possible:This adds an extra layer of security in case your account information is compromised. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE 5. Be mindful of camera placement:If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture. 6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it’s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach. 7. Use a VPN:Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using aVPN (Virtual Private Network) servicecan enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don’t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on yourWindows, Mac, Android & iOS devices 8. Regularly review privacy policies:Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information. 9. Considerhome security systemswith enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps: By actively managing these settings and using a VPN, you can significantly reduce your exposure to potential privacy risks associated with your smart home system. Check outmy picks for best security systems. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET The rapid rise of IoT tech has changed the way we live and interact. But without proper rules in place, companies might put profits over user safety. This can lead to devices with security holes and weaknesses.

        "content": "'The Big Money Show' co-host Brian Brenberg shows how inflation under President Biden has made life much more unaffordable for Americans on 'Varney & Co.' Egg productionin the U.S. dropped 4% in November as the price of eggs and cases of bird flu continue to rise across the country, according to a report from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service announced that in the month of November, egg production totaled 8.92 billion, which was down 4% from the same period last year. Of the 8.92 billion eggs produced, 7.68 billion were table eggs and 1.24 billion were hatching eggs, the key difference being that eating eggs are unfertilized and unable to become a chick. Also, in November, there were 376 million egg-laying eggs, down 3% from last year, and for every 100 layers, there was an average of 2,374 eggs produced. FDA RAISES COSTCO EGG RECALL TO HIGHEST RISK LEVEL OVER SALMONELLA FEARS Test tubes labelled \"Bird Flu\" and eggs are seen in this picture illustration.(Reuters/Dado Ruvic / Reuters Photos) Since November, the number of layers has dropped even more, with the USDA reporting a total of 375 million layers on Dec. 1, 2024, down 3% from last year. The news comes as egg prices are rising, a trend industry experts say will persist into 2025 if Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), also known as \"bird flu\" infections, continue. Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute Sector Manager Kevin Bergquist said egg prices have been elevated since 2023 due to the combination of seasonal price increases during the holidays and disruption in egg supply due to bird flu. HERE'S WHY GROCERS ARE REALLY RAISING PRICES Modern chicken farm for the breeding of white chickens and eggs, multi-level conveyor, indoor, copy space, poultry farming(iStock / iStock) Prices over the past year have \"generally\" remained above 2023 prices and even \"often exceeded egg prices from 2022, which was when HPAI really caught the egg market,\" according to Bergquist. Wholesale egg prices, which jumped nearly 55% in November, do not necessarily reflect consumer eggprices at the grocer,which can vary widely. According to the Consumer Price Index, grocery prices rose 0.5% in November, with four of the six major grocery store food groups rising in cost. Eggs showed the largest increase by a wide margin. EGG PRICES ARE HIGHER AND WILL CONTINUE INTO 2025 In the hands of a woman packing eggs in the supermarket(iStock / iStock) Prices for meat, poultry, and fish rose 1.7% in November, but prices for eggs rose 8.2%. Prior to the large bird flu outbreakin March 2022, flock numbers were at a level that supported lower egg prices, according to Bergquist. He noted the wholesale price was less than $1.50 per dozen. However, the outbreak disrupted the market, leading to record egg prices in December 2022. The average price corrected to a lower level by 2023 as producers rebuilt their flocks. Bergquist said that the flock size was hindered again when bird flu re-emerged in late 2023 and into 2024, resulting in under-supplied egg markets.

        "content": "Middle East Forum chief editor Jim Hanson on President-elect Donald Trump's warning for Hamas to free hostages immediately and the New Jersey drone frenzy. DearPresident-elect Donald Trump, My name is Ofri Bibas Levy. While you may not know me personally, you have surely heard of my brother Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri, and Ariel and Kfir, their two red-headed children who have captured hearts worldwide.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahupresented you with a photo of young Ariel holding his drawing of Batman, with the words \"I'm flying and saving people who are stuck in a hole\"—just as he and so many others remain trapped today. These children and their parents lived an ordinary family life—a busy routine of parents with two young children—until they were taken from usmore than a year ago. There is still hope: intelligence confirms that more than HALF of the 100 hostages still in captivityare alive, but their time is rapidly running out. My family members are among those we can still save, but only if we act now. The Bibas family, from left: Yarden, Ariel, Shiri, and Kfir(Ofri Bibas Levy) On Oct. 7, 2023, they were violently torn from their daily lives. Yarden, their father, made the heartbreaking choice to separate from his family in a desperate attempt to protect them, but despite his efforts, his young sons Ariel and Kfir were kidnapped along with their mother, Shiri. The footage of their abduction—showing the terrified children clutched in their mother's arms—became a haunting symbol of Hamas's cruelty. Two months later, Hamas's brutality reached new depths when they released a psychological warfare video showing them tormenting Yarden in captivity, cruelly telling him his wife and children were dead—trying to break his spirit. Recently, the world marked International Children's Rights Day, a commemoration first initiated by the Rev. Charles Leonard of the Universal Church in Chelsea, Mass., 168 years ago. On this significant day, the United Nations adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child—a powerful convention that places children's well-being above all other considerations. This declaration binds all of us to protect children from torture, exploitation, abuse, and neglect. Kfir Bibas, left, and Ofri Bibas Levy, right, smile together beneath a tree. Where is this commitment to these young children? Our shy, cheerful little Ariel was forced to mark his fifth birthday in Hamas tunnels, under the watchful eyes of murderous terrorists, far from the family and friends who love him. For over a year, we've been tormented by not knowing the conditions endured by him and his baby brother Kfir. Kidnapped when he was just nine months old, Kfir has already spent his first birthday in captivity and will soon mark his second birthday this January in terrorist hands—if we don't act quickly enough. Time is of the essence—while we know many hostages are still alive, their conditions deteriorate with each passing day. These innocent men, women, and children are fighting to survive under horrific conditions, making every moment of delay not just painful, but unforgivable. Kfir Bibas, at nine months old.(Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now) I turn to you, Mr. Trump, in desperation and plea: Help us where we have all failed. Use your unique, uncompromising, and creative approach to bring Kfir, Ariel, Shiri, and Yarden back to us. Returning all 100 hostages from Gaza is not just morally and ethically right—it's our human obligation. After so many agonizing months, there are finally talks of a deal. We must seize this opportunity to secure the release of all hostages held by Hamas—the men, women, elderly, and children—and reunite them with their families. Time is of the essence to push this deal forward, and the return of the hostages is a prerequisite for stability in the Middle East. There will be no peace until we bring them home: the living—who constitute more than half of those taken—for rehabilitation, and the dead for proper burial. We appreciate the efforts of the American administration and others over the past year, and we ask you, President-elect Trump, to lend us your voice and your hand so that Kfir and Ariel can celebrate their next birthday at home with us and their friends. It is their right and our duty. So many precious lives can still be saved."

Catastrophe struck on Jan. 12, a snowy Friday night. Although snug and safe in their home inBattle Lake, Minnesota, their mom and dad, Walter and Regina, were out drinking and driving, and in that deadly order. It was a single car accident on a lonely and cold road. There were no eyewitnesses, but we know Mrs. Baker, who was driving, lost control of the pickup truck. It rolled, tossing both of them. They suffocated to death in the snow. ADVENT 2024: RECLAIMING CHRISTMAS: LIVING OUT BIBLICAL LOVE With no will, their nine children were placed in foster care – various homes in the area. Because noise makes news and tragedy travels fast, the plight and heartbreak of the Baker Nine became something of a national concern. The Baker Nine in 1962, from left, Loretta Baker, Susan Baker, Sally Jo Meyers, Jim Meyers, Jerald Baker, Jeffrey Baker, Teresa Baker, Karen Meyers, Timothy Baker, Pauline Baker, Monica Jo Baker, Philip Baker, held by Jean, new mother. Over 1,300 miles away inCharlotte, North Carolina, Don and Jean Meyers were reading about the awful accident. It was one sentence in the story, though, that grabbed them and wouldn’t let go: \"The children won’t stay together,\" one of the neighbors told the reporter. \"Children need parents, and if these children were put in this world together, they should stay together,\" a defiant Jean told Don. \"We need children. We want these children.\" This is where the many layers and providential twists of the story begin to emerge. With two biological daughters, the Meyers had also previously adopted three boys, two of whom were twins. When the one twin son died in a drowning, Rev. J. Paul Bryon of St. Gabriel’s Church in Charlotte reached out to offer help. Grief can sometimes open previously closed hearts, and that’s exactly what happened. The Meyers, grateful for the love and support, wound upconverting to Catholicism. So, after seeing the story about the Bakers, Don Meyers called his parish priest, Father Bryon, who called Monsignor Michael J. Begley of Catholic Charities in Raleigh. The monsignor then called Catholic Charities in St. Cloud, Minnesota, which was managing the Baker case. ADVENT 2024: AS PEPPERDINE PRESIDENT, WE LEARNED THROUGH HARDSHIP CHRIST BRINGS LIGHT TO END THE DARKNESS \"There’s room here in our home and in our hearts,\" Don Meyers said at the time. \"God has blessed me with a generous income. I can afford to spend money raising children. It’s a small return for the blessings given us.\" It’s increasingly old-fashioned to see children as blessings, as priceless gifts. Instead, modern culture too often considers babies costly burdens to avoid. This narrow-mindedness not only deprives families of fun and fulfillment, but threatens our very existence. That’s because societies die when couples don’t marry and have children. Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem was the most famous adoption of all time, and a far cry from the idyllic picture painted on cards or sung about in carols.(iStock) The Baker Nine arrived and met their new parents at the Charlotte Airport on Dec. 17, 1962. There were plenty of smiles and hugs. The love was new but true. It would make for a goodHallmark Christmas movieif that’s where the story ended, but it’s really where it began. Monica Harbes, who was just 2 when her parents died and 3 when she arrived at the Meyers', remembers the plane ride. \"It was so exciting,\" she told me. Monica, along with her husband, Ed, now run the Harbes Family Farm out in Mattituck on the North Fork of Long Island. She says the Meyers \"ran a tight ship with lots of rules, lots of structure.\" The 13-sibling crew settled into a familiar if not challenging rhythm and routine. Their mother, who was a seamstress, stayed at home to raise the kids. They attended parochial school. All was well until tragedy struck again in 1969 when their adoptive mother died of lupus. \"The family imploded,\" Monica acknowledged. \"Our dad remarried. There were other children. There was favoritism. We all began to go our separate ways.\" At 14, Monica wound up moving to New York to live with her sister, Pauline, and new husband. Those were tough years. But it was only because she had moved toNew Yorkthat she met her beloved Ed. It was Ed who led Monica to the Lord, which led her to every other good thing. They have four sons, four daughters, and nine grandchildren.

It’s kind of messy, but so is life.\" This past Dec. 17, as they do every year, the original Bakers (two have since passed away) connect on the phone or via group text to remember and commemorate that dramatic and pivotal day back in 1962. It’s not coincidental that it coincides with Christmas. That’s becauseJesus’ birth in Bethlehemwas the most famous adoption of all time, and a far cry from the idyllic picture painted on cards or sung about in carols. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It’s a gritty story – an unmarried mother, an adoptive father, a baby born in filth far from fame and fortune, into a broken world with a king who felt threatened and wanted the baby killed. Christmas reminds us that life, like adoption, is unpredictable, often messy, also mysterious, and yet still beautiful. It shows us that a child (or nine of them!) can change everything for the better – and not just one day, but every day, and for all eternity. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA Paul J.

        "content": "'Fox & Friends Weekend' co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy reacts to some House Democrats vowing to boycott Trump's inauguration. Companies that previously feuded withPresident-elect Trumpare now making seven-figure donations to his 2025 inauguration. Trump has butted heads with several Fortune 500 company executives over the years, but following his presidential election victory in November, some of those same big-business leaders are dropping major cash on the incoming president's exclusive inaugural festivities. \"In the first term, everyone was fighting me. This time, everyone wants to be my friend,\" Trump recently said at Mar-a-Lago, according to The Washington Post. Meta, the world's largest social media network headed by Mark Zuckerberg,suspended Trump's Facebookand Instagram accounts in 2021 after the events of Jan. 6 — which Trump called an \"insult\" to his voters. In his new book, titled \"Save America,\" Trump accused Zuckerberg of \"plotting\" against him in 2020. DOJ SEEKS TO BLOCK JAN. 6 DEFENDANTS FROM ATTENDING TRUMP INAUGURATION Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms Inc., arrives following a break during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 31.(Kent Nishimura) \"He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the same time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me,\" Trump wrote. \"We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.\" Trump, in his book, also accused Zuckerberg of \"always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.\" However, the relationship appeared to change course as the election drew nearer. After Trump's Butler, Pennsylvania, assassination attempt in July, Zuckerberg said Trump's fist pump in the air after suffering a bullet wound to the ear was \"one of the most bada-- things I've ever seen in my life.\" Shortly after Trump won the election in November, Zuckerberg met with the incoming president at Mar-a-Lago. Just weeks later, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. JOHNSON ALLIES URGE TRUMP TO INTERVENE AS MESSY SPEAKER BATTLE THREATENS TO DELAY 2024 CERTIFICATION \"Mark Zuckerberg has been very clear about his desire to be a supporter of and a participant in this change that we're seeing all around America, all around the world with this reform movement that Donald Trump is leading,\" Trump adviser Stephen Miller said during an appearance on\"The Ingraham Angle.\" Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, is donating $1 million to Trump's 2025 inauguration.(AP Images) Despite a yearlong clash between Amazon's billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos — who also owns The Washington Post — and the incoming president, the e-commerce company recently pledged to donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. After Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2016 that Amazon was \"getting away with murder, tax-wise,\" Bezos fired back at the then-presidential candidate. Bezos, appearing at a technology conference, said that Trump's comments were \"not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave.\" \"Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn’t paying them enough. I think a really long strike would be a great idea,\" Trump wrote in another hit at the billionaire on X, then Twitter, in June 2018. \"Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time! Is @WaPo a registered lobbyist?\" The mood appeared to have shifted following the 2024 election, when Bezos said he was \"very optimistic\" about Trump's regulatory agenda. President-elect Trump smiles during Turning Point USA's AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix on Sunday.(Rebecca Noble) \"I’m very hopeful — he seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation,\" Bezos said at theNew York Times DealBook Summit. \"My point of view is, if I can help him do that, I’m going to help him.\" When Ford agreed to make a deal to meet California's efficiency standards, the company defied then-President Trump's plans to push back on the state setting its own green energy standards for automakers. Trump voiced his opposition to the auto giant's decision, saying that Henry Ford, the company's founder, would be \"very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesn’t work as well, because execs don’t want to fight California regulators.\" The blue oval logo of Ford Motor Company sits on the cross-hatched grille of a 2008 F-150 pickup truck at a Ford dealership in Centennial, Colorado, on Nov. 2, 2008.(David Zalubowski) Ford, one of the world's largest automakers, recently announced it will be making a seven-figure donation to Trump's inauguration in January. Other major automakers, such as GM and Toyota, will also make individual donations of $1 million to Trump.

        "content": "Aviation consultant Mike Boyd joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss a plane crash in South Korea leaving 177 dead. A fierySouth Korean plane crashwidely credited to failed landing gear has invited a flurry of speculation, including whether something more came into play leading up to the disaster. \"There are a million backups on this airplane. It's extremely safe, and that's what a lot of people are saying. They can't understand why this airplane was landed on that runway at that speed with no flaps, with no gear. There might have been something else involved,\" aviation consultant Mike Boyd told Fox News Sunday. \"A bird strike on an engine might shut an engine down, but there's so many redundant systems there, it just doesn't make sense. We're not in the dark, but we know the runway is 9,200 feet. It's a very long runway. It [the plane] did come in hot and high, hot and fast. We don't know why that was the real issue.\" Eyewitnesses to the crashthat killed 179 people said they observed flames in the aircraft's engine and heard explosions, reports say. One described seeing a \"flash of light\" followed by smoke. Another said the plane was unable to land in the initial attempt and had to circle back around to try again before the crash occurred. SOUTH KOREA PLANE'S FINAL MOMENTS CAPTURED ON VIDEO BEFORE HITTING CONCRETE BARRIER, TRIGGERING EXPLOSION Fire authorities search for the missing and recover the deceased at the site of an accident near Muan International Airport in Jeollanam-do, South Korea, on December 29, 2024, where a Jeju Air passenger plane collided during landing.(Chris Jung/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Yonhap News Agency said authorities are investigating a potential landing gear failure stemming from a bird strike that may have caused the crash. \"That airplane was probably damaged more than we think, and it may not have been just the bird strike,\" Boyd added. \"There might have been other things that happened to that airplane. We don't know, but it's very strange to have that airplane land that hot on a runway where it literally was still going pretty strong when they hit that wall.\" The Jeju Air flight skidded off the runway and crashed into a concrete fence at Muan International Airport in Muan, South Korea, roughly 190 miles south of Seoul, on Sunday, leaving only two survivors out of 181 onboard. Footage of the incident shows the 15-year-oldBoeing 737-800 jetsliding down the runway on its belly after its landing gear failed to deploy. The crash sent black smoke billowing toward the sky. \"The gear is not extended. The flaps are not extended, which would indicate that there was a major hydraulic failure of some kind there,\" Boyd observed.

That was not done. I think we're going to be kind of in the dark here 'til we find the cockpit voice recorder and the black box for this, because it looks like there was a bird strike from some earlier picture of it. They did vector the airplane around to the other end of the runway, so there was control but landing at this speed or coming down at that speed with the gear not down, it looks like that airplane suffered some major hydraulic failure of some kind.\" In a statement following the incident, Boeing stated the company is in contact with Jeju Air regarding the flight and is \"ready to support them.\" \"We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,\" the statement continued. The incident is being labeled the worst aviation-related disaster in the country's history.

It usually starts off by propelling her from one end of the stage to the other, but it quickly became clear it was not working that night, as Swift slid off and began walking across the stage. The singer took the malfunction and turned it into an iconic moment, as she went on to recreate the movements the platform was supposed to make in her dance moves.

It was just because Ang [his wife] said, ‘Get on that plane and make it happen.’\" He went on to win the whole competition, but not before performing with Journey during the show's finale, and Goodall has since performed the National Anthem at an Indiana Pacers game in November.

In these scenarios, servers often appear with a \"box\" or \"doggy bag\" ready to properly house the leftovers for customers' convenience. But while taking leftoversfrom a restaurantis common in the United States, it is less so in other countries. And there are some places, such as buffets, where to-go boxes are not a thing. PILE OF 'GARBAGE' FOODS WITH DEBATABLE TOPPINGS IS A DELICACY IN THIS US CITY Two restaurant industry professionals shared their views on when it is OK — and when it's not — to ask for a to-go box after a meal. Here are three issues that are sparking debate. At some restaurant chains – think Cheesecake Factory, Texas Road House andRed Lobster– the complimentary bread served before the meal is as much of a draw as the entrées themselves.

One restaurateur told Fox News Digital he would be \"flattered\" if someone took home the complimentary bread from the table.(iStock) Another person disagreed with that assessment. Kelli Ferrell, an Atlanta-based restaurateur, said that she personally is \"not a big bread person\" — and that she, as a customer dining out, would not take complimentary bread home from a restaurant. \"I get it,\" she said, noting that the rolls served at Texas Roadhouse are \"one of her favorites.\" MOM CHARGES FAMILY FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER AND MORE: ‘IT’S JUST SO EXPENSIVE' \"I think it's like a little treat,\" she told Fox News Digital.

It's about \"making the experience more comfortable for [people] and making sure they are feeling appreciated,\" said one restaurant owner.(iStock) This is not a big deal, both Ferrell and Friedlander told Fox News Digital. \"In my business, I tell my employees I don't want them to say ‘no’ to anything as long as we can possibly do it,\" Friedlander said.

While Ferrell said most items are perfectly fine to be packaged to-go, there's one exception: eggs. \"Eggs are always kind of a no-no. I can take everything else but that.\" \"Eggs for meare always kind of a no-no,\" she said, in terms of being wrapped to go. \"I can take everything else but that.\" Eggs, she said, are best served hot and freshly cooked.

        "content": "Yarden Gonen explains how President-elect Donald Trump’s victory gives hostages’ families renewed hope on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ In the delivery room of a hospital in Jerusalem, as the contractions intensified and the midwife tried to help the laboring woman shift to a more comfortable position, the mother felt something strange. \"She told me something was hurting her,\" recalled Erga Froman, the midwife. \"Then I realized it was my gun, which was holstered on a rotating belt and had shifted forward, touching her.\" After the baby was born, Froman's colleagues at the hospital took a photo of her standing next to the newborn, still wearing the gun. \"It's a picture of contrasts,\" she said. Before Oct. 7, Froman, a mother of five now living in the Golan Heights in northern Israel, had never considered obtaining a gun license. Having opted to do non-military national service instead of military service in the IDF, she had never fired a gun in her life. The change came swiftly afterHamas’ unprecedented terrorist attackon Israeli communities on Oct. 7, leaving over 1,200 dead and shattering a sense of security that many Israelis had long relied upon. TRUMP PROMISES 'HELL TO PAY' IN MIDDLE EAST IF HOSTAGES ARE NOT RELEASED BEFORE HE TAKES OFFICE A civil emergency team practices shooting in the city of Kiryat Shmona, which is within the range of rocket barrages fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon, March 4, 2024.(Erez Ben Simon/TPS-IL) \"On the evening of Oct. 7, my husband and I realized that because I travel alone at night on dangerous roads to my job – bringing life into the world – I needed protection,\" Froman told Fox News Digital. \"By the next morning, I had submitted my application for a gun license. Now I hope I’ll never need to use it, but I’m prepared if I have to.\" For decades, firearm ownership in Israel was uncommon. Although military service ensured that many Israelis were trained with weapons, personal firearms were seen as more of a liability than a necessity. The strict licensing process deterred many, and Israelis trusted the state and its defense forces to protect them from terror threats, which took precedence over Israel’s low crime rates. Midwife Erga Froman decided to get a gun license following the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks. But after the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7, many Israelis began to see personal firearms as a necessary safeguard in a new andmore dangerous reality. \"As there weren’t enough medical teams on Oct. 7, there also wasn’t enough defense,\" Froman noted. \"Learning from that, today we have a community medical team, and we are also armed to be able to give a first response.\" Erga Froman, a midwife from northern Israel, and her husband decided to get gun licenses following the Oct. 7 terror attacks. The Israeli Supreme Court is currently reviewing petitions against the nationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, alleging that his office issued firearm licenses without proper authority. In the months following the Oct. 7 attack, over 260,000 new gun license applications were submitted – nearly matching the total number from the previous two decades combined. More than 100,000 licenses have already been approved, marking a tenfold increase compared to the previous year. A woman shoots at a range in the Jordan Valley, Israel, April 10, 2024.(Yoav Dudkevitch/TPS-IL) Ayala Mirkin, a mother from Shiloh in Judea and Samaria, more widely known as the West Bank, applied for a firearm license after her husband, an IDF reserve soldier, was sent to fight in the war in Gaza, leaving her alone with their three young children. \"I felt unsafe driving through Arab villages and knew I had to do something to protect myself,\" she said. \"The process was much faster than it would have been before Oct. 7, but it still took months because of the flood of applications.\" Mirkin now carries her pistol whenever she leaves her settlement, though she remains conflicted. \"I don’t want to own a gun. The day I can give it back will be the happiest of my life. But I have no choice. It’s a tool for survival.\" ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRAUMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT For families like Mirkin’s, firearms have become part of everyday life. She keeps her gun securely locked in a safe and has trained her children never to touch it. \"It’s a tool for protection, not for killing,\" she emphasizes. \"My focus is on preserving life, not taking it.\" Oren Gozlan, a paratrooper veteran and father, is among those who hesitated before applying for a license. Living on theIsraeli sideof the Green Line border near the Palestinian city of Tulkarem, Gozlan decided he could no longer avoid arming himself. \"The fear of having a gun at home with kids still exists, but the need to protect my family outweighs it,\" he says. \"Oct. 7 changed everything. It brought the realization that we are vulnerable in ways we never imagined.\" Gozlan is unnerved by what he sees as inadequate oversight in the licensing process. \"At the range, I saw people who had never held a gun in their life, barely hitting their targets. It’s frightening to think these people are now walking around with firearms.\" Saar Zohar, a reservist in an elite unit, expressed a similar shift. For years, Zohar resisted owning a gun, believing it unnecessary after his service. But a series of terror attacks following Oct. 7 pushed him to reconsider. \"I couldn’t stand the thought of being helpless if something happened,\" he says. \"Knowing I have the training and can respond, I feel it is my responsibility.\" In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 massacre, Saar Zohar, a reservist in an elite unit of the IDF, decided to get a gun license.(Fox News) Unlike in the United States, wheregun ownershipis often linked to fears of crime or the defense of private property, firearms in Israel are seen as tools for countering terrorism. Historically, Israel has avoided the public mass shootings that have sometimesplagued the U.S.,but experts warn that the rapid proliferation of firearms could change this. With so many untrained individuals carrying weapons, the fear of impulsive actions and tragic mistakes looms large. Zohar is haunted by the potential for misidentification. \"The idea that another armed civilian might mistake me for an attacker terrifies me,\" he says, referencing a tragic incident in November 2023 when an Israeli civilian who had shot at terrorists in Jerusalem was mistakenly killed by a young soldier. The psychological toll of this shift is evident among those newly armed. Eyal Haskel, a father of three from Tel Aviv, describes the social pressures he faced after Oct. 7. \"I never wanted to carry a gun, but my friends questioned why I wasn’t armed. It felt like an expectation, almost a duty.\" OCTOBER 7 HASN'T ENDED. ONE YEAR LATER, 101 HOSTAGES ARE STILL BEING HELD IN GAZA Israelis train at a firing range, Feb. 12, 2023.(Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP via Getty Images) But Haskel is also disturbed by what he has seen at shooting ranges. \"People treat it like a game, firing without any understanding of the responsibility. It’s horrifying to think these people are now licensed.\" For many Israelis, the reform represents a necessary response to an existential threat. Yet, it has also exposed deep flaws in the system. Critics argue that the current approach sacrifices long-term safety for short-term security, warning of potential unintended consequences, from accidental shootings to a rise in domestic violence. SAVING LIVES ON 'DEATH STREET,' HOW AN ISRAELI KINDERGARTEN TEACHER BECAME A BATTLEFIELD HERO ON OCTOBER 7 \"Getting a gun license is easier than getting a driver’s license,\" Gozlan says. \"For a car, you need lessons, tests and strict rules. For a gun, it’s just some paperwork and a few hours at the range.\" Froman sees things differently. \"If someone threatens you, you only draw your weapon in a national security situation. You don’t pull a gun for personal life-threatening situations unless it’s a case of terrorists. The rules here are clear – you must have a safe for your weapon. I can’t rely on my husband’s safe; a firearm is personal. I’m not allowed to use his gun, and he’s not allowed to use mine. The regulations are very strict. The weapon is for defending against those who want to harm us, not for general self-defense.\" An Israeli soldier patrols near Kibbutz Beeri in southern Israel on Oct. 12, 2023, close to the place where 270 revelers were killed by terrorists during the Supernova music festival on Oct. 7.(Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images) Mirkin agrees. \"We’re not like America,\" she said. \"We don’t want guns as hobbies … for us, it’s survival, not choice.\" One interviewee who asked to remain anonymous described how he trained his wife in basic firearm handling, even though she doesn’t have a license. \"I never wanted to put her in this position, but if I’m not home during an attack, she needs to know how to defend our children.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As Israel adjusts to this new reality, the societal implications of increased firearm ownership remain uncertain. For many, the weight of these decisions highlights the delicate balance between protection and responsibility. \"I hope I’ll never have to use it,\" Gozlan says. \"But I can’t ignore the reality we live in.

        "content": "Pastor Kai Höss speaks with Fox News Digital from his home in Germany to share how he reconciles his Christian faith with what his grandfather Rudolf Höss did nearly 80 years ago. Kai Höss walks to the podium every Sunday at a small church in Germany to share a message of salvation and God’s grace and forgiveness. He’s the lead pastor at the Bible Church of Stuttgart, a non-denominational church that serves the English-speaking international community as well as U.S. service members and their families who are stationed in the area. He’s also the grandson of former Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf Höss, a Nazi official whooversaw the mass murderof an estimated 1.1 million people, the majority of them Jews, at the notorious extermination camp in southern Poland.

He was raised in a non-Christian home with non-believing parents, but his Grandma Caroline was a believer who \"understood Christ\" and the Gospel. \"I thought she was really weird,\" Höss admitted. He graduated from school, trained as a chef,joined the militaryand then studied hotel tourism management. He worked abroad for roughly 20 years, spending most of his time with big-name hotel chains like Sheraton and Shangri-La. \"I was a young urban professional full of myself, in love with myself, you know, Rolex, golden Amex, Mr. Cool, going to clubs, out every night. That was my life,\" he said. Pastor Kai Höss gives a sermon at the Bible Church of Stuttgart in Germany.(Credit: Kai Höss) It wasn’t until a medical operation went wrong that he turned his life around. He found a Bible in the hospital room, initially telling himself that he wasn’t going to read it, but continued book by book. He was saved in Singapore in 1989. \"God saved a wretch like me, you know? And that's what he does. And it never stops. His grace abounds,\" Höss said. The father of four openly speaks about his family’s past and his salvation and goes to schools to share his story andspeak out against antisemitism. Höss was in sixth or seventh grade when he discovered that Rudolf Höss was his grandfather, which left him feeling deeply ashamed.

He shared his testimony at a U.S. military retreat in Germany, where he was embraced by a Jewish military officer whose family had been murdered in Auschwitz. \"I started thinking, ‘How can I give something back? How can I do something to’ – I know I can't make it undone. I can’t reverse history, but I thought, you know, I can do something. I can just love them and what I can do, I can proclaim the truth from God's word to Christians,\" Höss said. Through Jesus Christ, he believes God's grace is able to redeem even the darkest past. When speaking to students in Germany, Höss addresses antisemitism by drawing connections between the past and the present,specifically referencing World War II, his grandfather’s role and the power of hate. He explains the concept of social Darwinism, which was used by the Nazis to justify their belief in racial superiority. He explains how Darwin’s theory of evolution was misapplied to humans, leading to the idea that certain races were \"stronger\" and more \"superior\" than others and thus had the right to dominate or eliminate \"weaker\" races. Höss emphasized that this false ideology fueled much of the hatred against Jews, along with other marginalized groups,during World War II.

He warns students about the danger of being swayed by superficial or biased content, emphasizing the importance of thinking critically and not simply swallowing information \"hook, line and sinker\" without considering the deeper truths or questioning the narrative. \"One of my friendscalled it TikTok mentality, TikTok brains, you know, you get these endorphins, you get these, you know, little hormone boosts every time you see a little clip. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And then it gets so addictive, right? And people get filled with the wrong idea. They don't look for deeper truth. They don't analyze,\" he told Fox News Digital.

Julia Wax, a Georgetown University law student,told \"Fox & Friends\"in the wake of Oct. 7 that college campuses are a \"hostile environment\" for Jewish students. \"People are scared to go to class. You have to sit next to classmates who are posting antisemitic rhetoric, who are promoting rallies that spew antisemitic rhetoric. People are scared, and the universities are not doing their part, and they're not stepping up, and they're staying silent,\" Wax said. Höss told Fox News Digital he hears people chanting\"From the river to the sea,\"but if you ask them what that river or sea is, \"they have no idea.\" \"They want to be part of something. They feel good about it. They get the basic message, the narrative. They've never really questioned both sides of the coin, so they don't really have the full information. They're not really interested because, again, it's emotional. It's an emotional response.\" Anti-Israel protesters at Columbia University.(Fox News) He critiqued how people, driven by ideologies or emotional narratives, can turn hatred into action, leading to harm and violence against others. \"We get infiltrated by ideas, ideologies, thoughts, emotions. And then we start going all for it. We go right out there, and we turn these thoughts into actions. And one of them is hatred and hatred turning into bloodshed. And that's exactly whatwe see on the campuses. We see people are willing to go out for this idea and do bad things. I mean, [they] don't realize that this Jewish person there is just, you know, a normal person like they themselves,\" Höss said. \"He's made of flesh and blood, right? He's a student. He's just a normal person. And here I hate someone because of something a government did somewhere on the other side of the planet, you know? And is everything that happened right? Perhaps not, you know, in that whole conflict there,\" he added, referring to the Israel-Hamas war. \"I hope they're going to come to a point now where this whole thing sort of slows down and people can help.\" Höss noted how much of the support for violence on campuses comes from people acting emotionally, often without a full understanding of the situation.(Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Höss and his fathertraveled to Auschwitzthree years ago when they were filming the HBO documentary \"The Commandant’s Shadow.\" They met with Holocaust survivor Anita Lasker-Wallfisch in her home and came to terms with Rudolf Höss’ murderous past. \"We pray for her,\" he added. \"And I feel so privileged and thankful, humbled that we were allowed to go there and my dad and I and just see her and spend time with her. A person that had suffered so much under my grandfather's cruel, cruel systemin that concentration camp.\" Höss has plans to speak at a synagogue in Freiburg, Germany, in January as part of the commemoration services for the 80th anniversary of Auschwitz’s liberation. \"[It’s] an amazing opportunity to speak up and to be part of something like that,\" he told Fox News Digital.

        "content": "Middle East Forum chief editor Jim Hanson on President-elect Donald Trump's warning for Hamas to free hostages immediately and the New Jersey drone frenzy. DearPresident-elect Donald Trump, My name is Ofri Bibas Levy. While you may not know me personally, you have surely heard of my brother Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri, and Ariel and Kfir, their two red-headed children who have captured hearts worldwide.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahupresented you with a photo of young Ariel holding his drawing of Batman, with the words \"I'm flying and saving people who are stuck in a hole\"—just as he and so many others remain trapped today. These children and their parents lived an ordinary family life—a busy routine of parents with two young children—until they were taken from usmore than a year ago. There is still hope: intelligence confirms that more than HALF of the 100 hostages still in captivityare alive, but their time is rapidly running out. My family members are among those we can still save, but only if we act now. The Bibas family, from left: Yarden, Ariel, Shiri, and Kfir(Ofri Bibas Levy) On Oct. 7, 2023, they were violently torn from their daily lives. Yarden, their father, made the heartbreaking choice to separate from his family in a desperate attempt to protect them, but despite his efforts, his young sons Ariel and Kfir were kidnapped along with their mother, Shiri. The footage of their abduction—showing the terrified children clutched in their mother's arms—became a haunting symbol of Hamas's cruelty. Two months later, Hamas's brutality reached new depths when they released a psychological warfare video showing them tormenting Yarden in captivity, cruelly telling him his wife and children were dead—trying to break his spirit. Recently, the world marked International Children's Rights Day, a commemoration first initiated by the Rev. Charles Leonard of the Universal Church in Chelsea, Mass., 168 years ago. On this significant day, the United Nations adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child—a powerful convention that places children's well-being above all other considerations. This declaration binds all of us to protect children from torture, exploitation, abuse, and neglect. Kfir Bibas, left, and Ofri Bibas Levy, right, smile together beneath a tree. Where is this commitment to these young children? Our shy, cheerful little Ariel was forced to mark his fifth birthday in Hamas tunnels, under the watchful eyes of murderous terrorists, far from the family and friends who love him. For over a year, we've been tormented by not knowing the conditions endured by him and his baby brother Kfir. Kidnapped when he was just nine months old, Kfir has already spent his first birthday in captivity and will soon mark his second birthday this January in terrorist hands—if we don't act quickly enough. Time is of the essence—while we know many hostages are still alive, their conditions deteriorate with each passing day. These innocent men, women, and children are fighting to survive under horrific conditions, making every moment of delay not just painful, but unforgivable. Kfir Bibas, at nine months old.(Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now) I turn to you, Mr. Trump, in desperation and plea: Help us where we have all failed. Use your unique, uncompromising, and creative approach to bring Kfir, Ariel, Shiri, and Yarden back to us. Returning all 100 hostages from Gaza is not just morally and ethically right—it's our human obligation. After so many agonizing months, there are finally talks of a deal. We must seize this opportunity to secure the release of all hostages held by Hamas—the men, women, elderly, and children—and reunite them with their families. Time is of the essence to push this deal forward, and the return of the hostages is a prerequisite for stability in the Middle East. There will be no peace until we bring them home: the living—who constitute more than half of those taken—for rehabilitation, and the dead for proper burial. We appreciate the efforts of the American administration and others over the past year, and we ask you, President-elect Trump, to lend us your voice and your hand so that Kfir and Ariel can celebrate their next birthday at home with us and their friends. It is their right and our duty. So many precious lives can still be saved."

It'll be just the happiest moment for all of the families.

Kayla Mamelak Altus, a representative for Adams, told Fox News Digital that the mayor has \"surged 1,000 police officers per day into the subways, has brought down overall crime, and transit crime, delivering real action — not theatrics.\" \"Mayor Adamsis committed to improving the lives of New Yorkers, which is why he frequently rides the subway to speak directly with everyday riders about how we can make it safer,\" said Altus. \"But he knows there’s still more work to be done,\" Altus added. \"Unlike others who only seek attention with meaningless stunts, Mayor Adams remains focused on real solutions.\" MAYOR ADAMS CALLS FOR THE 'INVOLUNTARY REMOVAL' OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 'A DANGER TO OTHERS' ON THE STREETS New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a press conference at City Hall following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming \"border czar\" Tom Homan, Thursday, Dec. 12, 2024, in New York.(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) In response, Sliwa urged Adams to station more police officers in the subway and challenged the mayor to join him in doing regular daily patrols on the subway to see how bad the problems have gotten since the surge in migrants in the city. \"Head into the subway and patrol yourself,\" Sliwa said, speaking directly to Adams. \"I'll match him. I go four hours a day, even with my busy schedule. The mayor has a busy schedule. He can run one patrol with his police. I'll run a patrol with the Guardian Angels. That’s two more patrols we will have that we didn't have before.\" \"We're in a crime crisis, and the mayor should be happy to accept anybody's help at this time,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"So, if we're willing to patrol on the subways where it's desperately needed in the cars as they're moving, why would the mayor or anyone say it's theatrics?\" \"The mayor and the governor have not met their primary responsibility, which is to provide public safety to the people in the subway,\" he went on. \"So, if you're unwilling to do the job or maybe you can't and won't admit it, they should be welcoming all the help they can get from an organization that is renowned for 46 years of service to New Yorkers, asking nothing in return.\" DR.

We need to rescue these people and get them mental health care. Shame on the fact that the mayor spent billions of our tax dollars housing migrants, but not our own citizens who live in the subways. The subway trains have become moving hotels. \"If the mayor was doing a good job… nobody would be asking for the Guardian Angels to patrol the subways,\" he added. \"The people want police, and if they don't have police, they're more than happy to accept the service of the volunteer Guardian Angels.\" Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital."

Smugglers abandoned two migrant children at the southern border inTexas this week, fleeing back to Mexico as Texas authorities came to the little girls’ rescue, amid continued concerns about the numbers of unaccompanied minors coming across the border. TheTexas Department of Public Safetysaid that its troopers had recovered the two little girls, who are five and nine years old, after the smuggler had abandoned them and fled back to Mexico. The girls, from El Salvador, carried only a note with an address and phone number, and were then referred to U.S. Border Patrol. ICE DEPORTATIONS CATCH UP TO TRUMP-ERA NUMBERS IN FY 2024 AS BIDEN ADMIN COMES TO A CLOSE Texas troopers rescued two girls abandoned at the southern border.(Texas Department of Public Safety.) The incident taps into ongoing concerns about unaccompanied migrant children coming across the border, with numbers increasing significantly during the recent migrant crisis. There have been a number of incidents of abandoned children being rescued, often with phone numbers or addresses of relatives or others written on paper or stitched into clothing. When children arrive unaccompanied, they are transferred eventually to theDepartment of Health and Human Services(HHS) and released to sponsors in the U.S. A National Guard soldier stands guard on the banks of the Rio Grande at Shelby Park on January 12, 2024, in Eagle Pass, Texas.(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) The issue made headlines earlier this year when the DHS Office of Inspector General sent a report to Congress finding that, over the past five years, more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children [UCs] had not shown up for immigration court hearings, and thatImmigration and Customs Enforcementcould not account for the location of all of those who did not appear. \"During our ongoing audit to assess ICE’s ability to monitor the location and status of UCs who were released or transferred from the custody of the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), we learned ICE transferred more than 448,000 UCs to HHS from fiscal years 2019 to 2023,\" the internal watchdog reported.

        "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-magas-h-1b-civil-war-exactly-how-politics-supposed-work",
        "content": "American Majority founder and CEO Ned Ryun joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss Republicans divided over H-1B visas and Vivek Ramaswamy's comments calling out U.S. culture of 'mediocrity'. There are two pieces of very good news that have come out of theinfighting over H-1B visasfor foreign skilled workers in Trump World this week. The first happy accident is that tensions are already easing, much to the chagrin of liberals who hoped they were witnessing a permanent schism. The second, even better development, is that both sides of the admittedly zesty debate have listened, compromised, and arrived at a better and clearer set of positions for the Republican Party moving forward. A side-by-side of Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk.(Getty Images/AP Images) In the red corner, we had the twin heads of the Department of Government Efficiency, Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk who appeared at first to call for expansion of the H-1B visa program that allows employers to use foreign labor when they cannot find qualified Americans. In the other red corner, we had Steve Bannon and a host of prominent America Firsters all but calling for an end of the skilled foreign worker program, a policy that would no doubt cause considerable chaos and disruption. On Saturday,President-elect Trump weighed in, sort of, telling the New York Post that he likes the visa program and uses it himself, but not endorsing any expansion. And this is of course the same Trump whofired board members of the Tennessee Valley Authorityfor using foreign workers over Americans. By Sunday morning, as parents quietly sipped coffee and spied the news on their phones, the kids getting a little more sleep before church, things had calmed down considerably in this impromptu intramural immigration debate. For his part, Ramaswamy, afteran ill-advised X postthis week criticizing American families for having more sleepovers and movie nights than their South Asian counterparts, has backed off of his cultural high hill and retrained his sights on the real issue at hand. The only real losers in the wake of this kerfuffle are the Democrats and liberal talking heads who hoped that they were watching MAGA tear itself apart. Meanwhile, Musk arguably moved even further to the center of the issue, posting late Saturday night that the excesses of the H-1B visa program are \"easily fixed by raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H-1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically.\" Or as Musk ally and head of Trump’s office of Artificial IntelligenceDavid Sacks put it, ‘Elon has said that H1B should be overhauled, that it should focus on exceptional talent in high-value areas, and that the scams and low-pay jobs should end. This is not to say there aren’t still differences but less than it first appeared. Time to move forward as one team.’ This is music to the ears of the America First crowd and great news for the young American architect or graphic designer who just wants a level playing field, one where they don’t lose again and again to cheap foreign competition. Meanwhile, the Bannonistas, who have been by Trump’s side from the very beginning a decade ago, are easing their attacks on newcomers Ramaswamy and Musk, and appreciating that they are all on the same team. The only real losers in the wake of this kerfuffle are the Democrats and liberal talking heads who hoped that they were watching MAGA tear itself apart. As Republicans work out their differences, instead of munching on popcorn, the left is eating crow. There are some lessons to take from the recent unpleasantness. At one point, some in the pro H-1B crowd, and some on the left, accused those in opposition of anti-South Asian racism, a terrible lie and an even worse message. Thankfully, this did not last long. And it is important that the generally leftist tactic of pointing and yelling racism did not work because these are exactly the fights that make our foreign foes with their trolling social media bot farms drool, and they were working overtime to divide Americans this week. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Thankfully, it failed. In the end, as tempers cooled and discourse bent back in the direction of congeniality and good faith. What we are left with is a fructive and fulsome debate over a nuanced issue. Of course, the United States wants to attract the best and the brightest to help chart out a technological course forward, but we also don’t want to tell a truck driver that the kid he sends to college is going to get passed over for cheaper foreign counterparts. The opportunity to balance these concerns over attracting the best from elsewhere, while not burdening our own citizens' ability to achieve is upon us. Compromise really is possible. It might not always look like a church social, it might get a little rough around the edges, but as a wise man once said, ‘politics ain’t beanbag.’ CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump takes office in about three weeks, and it bodes well for his upcoming four years as president that those who serve and support can not only argue with pointed vigor, but also come together with an honest give and take when called for. The battle of the H-1B turned out not to be a crisis in MAGAland, but rather a roadmap for compromise and competent governance.

That’s why we have them,\" Trump told theNew York PostSaturday. Trump said that he recognizes the visas on his properties, saying, \"I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program.\" MUSK INFLAMES X WITH PROFANE MOVIE QUOTE IN DEFENSE OF H1-B VISA President-elect Donald Trump smiles during Turning Point USA's AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center, Dec. 22, in Phoenix.(Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Trump's comments come as the right clashes over immigration and the place of foreign workers in the U.S. labor market. Muskand Vivek Ramaswamy,who have been tapped by Trump to lead his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), argued earlier this week that American culture has not prioritized education enough, and therefore that foreign workers are needed for tech companies like Musk’s SpaceX and Tesla. Many tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. Conservative pundit Laura Loomer speaks to the media in New York City.(David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) One such critic, Laura Loomer, set off a firestorm on X when criticizing Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence policy. MUSK AND RAMASWAMY IGNITE MAGA WAR OVER SKILLED IMMIGRATION AND AMERICAN ‘MEDIOCRITY’ In a post, she said she was concerned that Krishnan, a U.S. citizen, would have an influence on theTrump administration’s immigrationpolicies. \"It’s alarming to see the number of career leftists who are now being appointed to serve in Trump’s admin when they share views that are in direct opposition to Trump’s America First agenda,\" she wrote. Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk.(Getty Images/AP Images) Musk has doubled-down on his position, taking to X on Friday to blast a user who showed a video of him discussing SpaceX processes to go after the billionaire’s stance on the visa program. \"The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,\" Musk wrote on X. He then went on to quote the 2008action-comedy movie,\"Tropic Thunder,\" which was a box office hit. \"Take a big step back and F--- YOURSELF in the face,\" Musk railed.
